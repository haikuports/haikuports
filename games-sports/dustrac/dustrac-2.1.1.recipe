SUMMARY="An open-source, tile-based 2D racing game with a level editor"
DESCRIPTION="Dust Racing 2D (dustrac) is an open source, tile-based 2D racing \
game developed by Jussi Lind and contributors.

The purpose of the game is to race against challenging computer players on \
different race tracks. Finishing in TOP-6 will unlock a new race track. Only a \
small portion of the race track is visible on the scrolling screen.

There's also an option for a split-screen two player game, introduced in \
0.12.0. Dust Racing 2D comes with a Qt-based level editor that makes creating \
new race tracks easy."
