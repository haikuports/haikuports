SUMMARY="A password generator"
DESCRIPTION="The pwgen program generates passwords which are designed to be easily \
memorized by humans, while being as secure as possible. Human- memorable \
passwords are never going to be as secure as completely completely random \
passwords. In particular, passwords generated by pwgen without the -s option \
should not be used in places where the password could be attacked via an \
off-line brute-force attack. On the other hand, completely randomly generated \
passwords have a tendency to be written down, and are subject to being \
compromised in that fashion.\
The pwgen program is designed to be used both interactively, and in shell \
scripts. Hence, its default behavior differs depending on whether the standard \
output is a tty device or a pipe to another program. Used interactively, pwgen \
will display a screenful of passwords, allowing the user to pick a single \
password, and then quickly erase the screen. This prevents someone from being \
able to 'shoulder surf' the user's chosen password."
