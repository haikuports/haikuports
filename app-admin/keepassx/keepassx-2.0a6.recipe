SUMMARY="Qt password manager"
DESCRIPTION="
KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on secure \
personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross platform and \
published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
KeePassX saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords, urls, \
attachments and comments in one single database. For a better management \
user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each single entry. \
Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are customizable as well. \
The integrated search function allows to search in a single group or the \
complete database.
KeePassX offers a little utility for secure password generation. The password \
generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use. Especially someone who \
generates passwords frequently will appreciate this feature."
