SUMMARY="The standard unix password manager"
DESCRIPTION="Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass, each \
password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or \
resource that requires the password. These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder \
hierarchies, copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command \
line file management utilities.

pass makes managing these individual password files extremely easy. All passwords live in \
~/.password-store, and pass provides some nice commands for adding, editing, generating, and \
retrieving passwords. It is a very short and simple shell script. It's capable of temporarily \
putting passwords on your clipboard and tracking password changes using git.

You can edit the password store using ordinary unix shell commands alongside the pass command. \
There are no funky file formats or new paradigms to learn. There is bash completion so that you \
can simply hit tab to fill in names and commands, as well as completion for zsh and fish available \
in the completion folder. The very active community has produced many impressive clients and GUIs \
for other platforms as well as extensions for pass itself. The pass command is extensively \
documented in its man page."
