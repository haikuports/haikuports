SUMMARY="Qt password manager"
DESCRIPTION="KeePassXC is an application for people with extremly high \
demands on secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is \
cross platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
KeePassXC saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords, urls, \
attachments and comments in one single database. For a better management \
user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each single entry. \
Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are customizable as well. \
The integrated search function allows to search in a single group or the \
complete database.
KeePassXC offers a little utility for secure password generation. The \
password generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use. Especially \
someone who generates passwords frequently will appreciate this feature.
KeePassXC is a community fork of KeePassX which aims to incorporate stalled \
pull requests, features, and bug fixes that have never made it into the main \
KeePassX repository."
