SUMMARY="A C library to run an HTTP server as part of another application"
DESCRIPTION="GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make \
it easy to run an HTTP server as part of another application. GNU GNU \
Libmicrohttpd is free software and part of the GNU project. Key features \
that distinguish GNU Libmicrohttpd from other projects are:

* C library: fast and small
* API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
* Implementation is HTTP 1.1 compliant
* HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
* Four different threading models (select, poll, pthread, thread pool)
* Supported platforms include GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Android,
* OSX, W32, Symbian and z/OS
* Support for IPv6
* Support for SHOUTcast
* Support for incremental processing of POST data (optional)
* Support for basic and digest authentication (optional)
* Support for SSL3 and TLS (requires libgcrypt and libgnutls, optional)
* Binary is only about 32k (without TLS/SSL support and other optional features)

GNU Libmicrohttpd was started because the author needed an easy way to add a \
concurrent HTTP server to other projects. Existing alternatives were either \
non-free, not reentrant, standalone, of terrible code quality or a \
combination thereof. Do not use GNU Libmicrohttpd if you are looking for a \
standalone HTTP server, there are many other projects out there that provide \
that kind of functionality already. However, if you want to be able to serve \
simple WWW pages from within your C or C++ application, check it out."
