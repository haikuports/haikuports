SUMMARY="Qt-based client-side and server-side SOAP component"
DESCRIPTION="KD Soap is a Qt-based client-side and server-side SOAP component.

It can be used to create client applications for web services and also provides \
the means to create web services without the need for any further component \
such as a dedicated web server.

KDSoap also supports writing SOAP servers easily.

KD Soap targets C++ programmers who use Qt in their applications."
