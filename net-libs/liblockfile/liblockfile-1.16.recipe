SUMMARY="Implements functions designed to lock the standard mailboxes"
DESCRIPTION="This library implements a number of functions found in -lmail \
on SysV systems. These functions are designed to lock the standard mailboxes \
in /var/mail (or wherever the system puts them).

In additions, this library adds a number of functions to create, \
manage and remove generic lockfiles.

The lockfiles are created by this library in an NFS-safe manner, that \
is by using a tempfile and using link(2) to create the lockfile. It \
works around several defects in NFS servers to make sure the lockfile \
is created atomically.

The locking strategy is compatible with other well-written NFS-safe \
programs that create lockfiles - such as procmail, exim and mutt.

If you are trying to lock a mailbox in a directory writable for group \
mail, the locking functions will call a helper application which runs \
setgid to do the actual locking. The helper application \"dotlockfile\" \
can also be used directly, for example for use in shellscripts.

This means a program such as a MUA doesn't need to be setgid mail anymore \
to be able to lock the mailbox."
