SUMMARY="A utility for network discovery and security auditing"
DESCRIPTION="Nmap (\"Network Mapper\") is a free and open source license \
utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network \
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, \
managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. \
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available \
on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are \
offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what \
type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other \
characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works \
fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, \
and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. \
In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite \
includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data \
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing \
scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool \
(Nping)."
