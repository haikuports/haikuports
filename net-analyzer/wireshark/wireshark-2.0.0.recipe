SUMMARY="A network protocol analyzer formerly known as ethereal"
DESCRIPTION="Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer, or "sniffer", for Unix \
and Unix-like operating systems. It uses Qt, a graphical user interface \
library, and libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

The Wireshark distribution also comes with TShark, which is a \
line-oriented sniffer (similar to Sun's snoop, or tcpdump) that uses the \
same dissection, capture-file reading and writing, and packet filtering \
code as Wireshark, and with editcap, which is a program to read capture \
files and write the packets from that capture file, possibly in a \
different capture file format, and with some packets possibly removed \
from the capture."
