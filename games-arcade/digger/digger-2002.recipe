SUMMARY="An arcade-style game similar to dig dug"
DESCRIPTION="Digger was originally created by Windmill software in 1983 and \
released as a copy-protected, bootable 5.25 floppy disk for the IBM PC. 
As it requires a genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs.
In 1998, I created Digger Remastered, which runs on all PCs with CGA \
or better and plays just like the original. 
It also has many new features, including:

- Exit button
- Optional VGA graphics
- Recording and playback
- Real time speed control
- Keyboard redefinition
- Gauntlet mode
- Two player simultaneous mode"
