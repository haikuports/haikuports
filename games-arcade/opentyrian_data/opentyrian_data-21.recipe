SUMMARY="A port of the DOS shoot-em-up Tyrian (data files) "
DESCRIPTION="OpenTyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter. The story is set in the \
year 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed to fight Microsol \
and save the galaxy. February 2007 the Pascal source code for Tyrian was licensed for a small \
group of developers to re-write it in C, in a project named OpenTyrian, licensed under the GNU \
General Public License. Following that announcement, in April 2007 Daniel Cook announced the \
free availability of his Tyrian artwork under generic liberal terms."
