I have written the xrick code. However, graphics and maps and sounds are by the
authors of the original Rick Dangerous game, and "Rick Dangerous" remains a
trademark of its owners (Core Design) who have yet to reply to my emails.

This makes it a bit difficult to formally release the whole code, including
data for graphics and maps and sounds, under the terms of licences such as the
GNU General Public License. So the code is released in the spirit of the GNU
GPL. Whatever that means. Do what you want with it, but please let me know. I
hate it when I discover xrick has been ported to the FooDoo GameSphereTM and I
was not even aware of it.
