SUMMARY="Find treasure and escape back to save the Goon Docks from demolition"
DESCRIPTION="The action takes place in the sleepy seaside town of Cauldron \
Point - down in an area known as the Goon Docks. The Goonies are a group of \
local kids - Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Chunk and Data. One day they find an old \
treasure map in Mikey's attic.
Data figures that this must be the fabulous hidden treasure of the \
notorious local pirate, One-Eyed Willy.
The girls, Andy and Stef, join the other Goonies and the adventure begins. But \
the secret underground tunnels they are exploring are actually the hideout of \
the Fratelli Gang, and the Goonies are soon trapped! The Goonies have a \
powerful ally on their side, however, in the form of the huge and amiable Sloth.

When you play this game, you are Sloth! Can you help the Goonies find the \
treasure and escape back to save the Goon Docks from demolition?"
