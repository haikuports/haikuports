DESCRIPTION="
The Maze of Galious (MoG in short) was originally a Konami game for the MSX
computer system. Its real name is Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious and is the
sequel of another Konami game called Knightmare.

MoG is a very addictive game where you have to kill thousands of enemies,
collect items in order to obtain new powers and defeat some really great demons
at the end of each level. The gameplay of MoG is not the boring linear one. In
MoG you are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game. You
have to be very careful of the order in which you visit all the rooms in the
HUGE map if you want to keep your character alive. The map is structured in a
main map (called the castle) and 10 submaps (called the worlds). Initially you
are in the castle and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to
each of the worlds. To complete the game you have to defeat the boss at the end
of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as
you want in order to see if you have missed something. To defeat all 10 demons
you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite. Each one has special
abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to
dive.
