SUMMARY="The Maze of Galious"
DESCRIPTION="The Maze of Galious (MoG in short) was originally a Konami game \
for the MSX computer system. Its real name is Knightmare II: The Maze of \
Galious and is the sequel of another Konami game called Knightmare.

MoG is a very addictive game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, \
collect items in order to obtain new powers and defeat some really great \
demons at the end of each level. The gameplay of MoG is not the boring linear \
one. In MoG you are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the \
game. You have to be very careful of the order in which you visit all the \
rooms in the HUGE map if you want to keep your character alive.

The map is structured in a main map (called the castle) and 10 submaps \
(called the worlds). Initially you are in the castle and you have to find the \
keys that open the doors to go to each of the worlds.
To complete the game you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of \
the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want in \
order to see if you have missed something.

To defeat all 10 demons you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite. \
Each one has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump \
and Aphrodite is able to dive."
