SUMMARY="The Maze of Galious"
DESCRIPTION="
The Maze of Galious (MoG in short) was originally a Konami game for the MSX \
computer system. Its real name is Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious and is \
the sequel of another Konami game called Knightmare.

MoG is a very addictive game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, \
collect items in order to obtain new powers and defeat some really great demons \
at the end of each level. The gameplay of MoG is not the boring linear one. In \
MoG you are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game. You \
have to be very careful of the order in which you visit all the rooms in the \
HUGE map if you want to keep your character alive.

The map is structured in a main map (called the castle) and 10 submaps (called \
the worlds). Initially you are in the castle and you have to find the keys \
that open the doors to go to each of the worlds.
To complete the game you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the \
10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want in order to \
see if you have missed something.

To defeat all 10 demons you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite. \
Each one has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump \
and Aphrodite is able to dive."
