SUMMARY="A platform game in which you're a bear whose son has been kidnapped"
DESCRIPTION="Plee the Bear is a platform game in which you play an angry bear \
whose son has been kidnapped by god. Here is a guy hard to brave! Jump in \
this amazing journey to find and rescue your son. Because you want to rescue \
him, don't you? Or to slap him? Maybe both…

With three levels of the storyline and four mini-games, Plee the Bear \
received very positive criticisms. The players loved the fun, the graphics and \
the music; the community around the free software movement appreciated the \
overall process and the quality of the resources, remarkable for a free game; \
and the indie gaming community was pleasantly surprised by the technical \
skills and the details of the game."
