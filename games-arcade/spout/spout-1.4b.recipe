SUMMARY="A simple caveflying game"
DESCRIPTION="Spout was originally written for a handheld by kuni, and soon \
afterwards was ported to Windows using Cygwin and SDL and released under the \
MIT license.

In 2004 a 'Unix version' was released, which mostly just slapped autotools \
into the Windows version and infringed the license.

This is a new Unix version, based on the original Windows code by kuni, \
which aims to add useful features and simplify the code.
