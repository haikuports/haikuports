SUMMARY="Play cute bunnies jumping on each other's heads"
DESCRIPTION="This is a game for the whole family. You play cute fluffy little \
bunnies and hop on each other's heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to let each active \
player juimp over the tree trunk to enter the play area, and then walk to the \
right. You will then enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the other bunnies' \
heads...

Jump 'n Bump was originally a DOS game by Brainchild Design, which was open \
sourced under the GPL license and ported to SDL, and then SDL 2."
