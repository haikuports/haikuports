SUMMARY="A cross-platform build system"
DESCRIPTION="CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package \
software. It is used to control the software compilation process using \
simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates \
native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment \
of your choice."
