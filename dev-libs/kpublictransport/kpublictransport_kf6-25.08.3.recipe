SUMMARY="Library to assist with accessing public transport timetables and other data"
DESCRIPTION="A library for accessing realtime public transport data and for performing public \
transport journey queries.
This includes:

* Finding bus stops or train stations, departures/arrivals from there, and journeys between those.
* Path and routing information for individual transport sections of a journey.
* Information about train coach and train station platform layouts.
* Information about rental vehicle positions and availability, such as shared bikes or scooters.
* Realtime information about the operational status of elevators or escalators.
* Unified access to onboard API on trains for obtaining the current position and journey.

!! Before using this, please read the license compliance and attribution section below !!

* When using the data retrieved by this library you need to comply with the license terms of the \
backends this is coming from, in particular https://www.navitia.io/api-term-of-use.
* Attribution information that need to be displayed in an appropriate place in the application using \
this are provided globally via KPublicTransport::Manager::attributions() as well as more \
fine-grained per query reply via KPublicTransport::Reply::attributions().
* Besides attributing backend data correctly, this library also contains static data retrieved from \
Wikidata licensed as CC0 as well as data from OpenStreetMap licensed as ODbL, so those should be \
appropriately credited in your application as well."
