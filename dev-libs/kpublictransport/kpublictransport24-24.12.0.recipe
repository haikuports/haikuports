SUMMARY="Library to assist with accessing public transport timetables and other data"
DESCRIPTION="A library for accessing realtime public transport data and for performing public \
transport journey queries.
This includes:

Finding bus stops or train stations, departures/arrivals from there, and journeys between those.
Path and routing information for individual transport sections of a journey.
Information about train coach and train station platform layouts.
Information about rental vehicle positions and availability, such as shared bikes or scooters.
Realtime information about the operational status of elevators or escalators.
Unified access to onboard API on trains for obtaining the current position and journey.
