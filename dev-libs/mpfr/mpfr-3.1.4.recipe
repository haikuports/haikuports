SUMMARY="Multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding"
DESCRIPTION="The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision \
floating-point computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been \
supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the Caramel and \
AriC project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) \
respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP \
multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision \
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined \
semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for \
double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand).

MPFR is free. It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License \
(GNU Lesser GPL), version 3 or later (2.1 or later for MPFR versions until \
2.4.x). The library has been registered in France by the Agence de Protection \
des Programmes under the number IDDN FR 001 120020 00 R P 2000 000 10800, on \
15 March 2000. This license guarantees your freedom to share and change MPFR, \
to make sure MPFR is free for all its users. Unlike the ordinary General \
Public License, the Lesser GPL enables developers of non-free programs to use \
MPFR in their programs. If you have written a new function for MPFR or \
improved an existing one, please share your work!"
