SUMMARY="Libraries to dump and manipulate DWARF data"
DESCRIPTION="DWARF is a widely used, standardized debugging data format. \
DWARF was originally designed along with Executable and Linkable Format (ELF),\
although it is independent of object file formats. The name is a medieval \
fantasy complement to ELF that has no official meaning, although the \
backronym 'Debugging With Attributed Record Formats' was later proposed.

The DWARF Debugging Information Format is of interest to programmers working \
on compilers and debuggers (and anyone interested in reading or writing DWARF \
information). DWARF uses a data structure called a Debugging Information Entry \
(DIE) to represent each variable, type, procedure, etc. It was developed by a \
committee (known as the PLSIG at the time) starting around 1991. Starting \
around 1991 SGI developed the libdwarf and dwarfdump tools for internal use and \
as part of SGI IRIX developer tools. Since that time dwarfdump and libdwarf \
have been shipped (as an executable and archive respectively, not source) with \
every release of the SGI MIPS/IRIX C compiler. In 1994 (I think the correct \
year) SGI agreed to open-source libdwarf (and in 1999 to open-source dwarfdump) \
so anyone could use them.
