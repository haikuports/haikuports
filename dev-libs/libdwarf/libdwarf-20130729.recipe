SUMMARY="libdwarf and dwarfdump - library and utility for working with DWARF Debugging Information Format"
DESCRIPTION="
	DWARF is a widely used, standardized debugging data format. DWARF was
	originally designed along with Executable and Linkable Format (ELF),
	although it is independent of object file formats. The name is a
	medieval fantasy complement to ELF that has no official meaning,
	although the backronym 'Debugging With Attributed Record Formats' was
	later proposed.

	The DWARF Debugging Information Format is of interest to programmers
	working on compilers and debuggers (and anyone interested in reading or
	writing DWARF information). DWARF uses a data structure called a
	Debugging Information Entry (DIE) to represent each variable, type,
	procedure, etc. It was developed by a committee (known as the PLSIG at
	the time) starting around 1991. Starting around 1991 SGI developed the
	libdwarf and dwarfdump tools for internal use and as part of SGI IRIX
	developer tools. Since that time dwarfdump and libdwarf have been
	shipped (as an executable and archive respectively, not source) with
	every release of the SGI MIPS/IRIX C compiler. In 1994 (I think the
	correct year) SGI agreed to open-source libdwarf (and in 1999 to
	open-source dwarfdump) so anyone could use them.
	
	libdwarf allows reading, creation and manipulation of dwarf data.
	dwarfdump (written in C) and dwarfdump2 (written in C++) do the same
	job, they let you dump out, in readable form, the DWARF2, DWARF3, or
	DWARF4 data from an object file, but dwarfdump2 does a better job in
	some respects.

	This package includes dwarfdump2 and libdwarf, although the source
	package has been patched to make dwarfdump and dwarfgen haiku
	compatible as well.
