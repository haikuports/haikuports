SUMMARY="A configuration file parser library"
DESCRIPTION="libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed \
under the terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections \
and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other \
sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted \
strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include \
statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability to \
a program using a simple API.
The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library \
with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to \
integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but its name \
was changed to not confuse itself with other similar libraries."
