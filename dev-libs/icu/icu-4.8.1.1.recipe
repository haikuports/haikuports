DESCRIPTION="
ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode \
and Globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable \
and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and \
Java software.
ICU is released under a nonrestrictive open source license that is suitable \
for use with both commercial software and with other open source or free \
software.
Here are a few highlights of the services provided by ICU:
* Code Page Conversion: Convert text data to or from Unicode and nearly any \
other character set or encoding. ICU's conversion tables are based on charset \
data collected by IBM over the course of many decades, and is the most \
complete available anywhere.
* Collation: Compare strings according to the conventions and standards of a \
particular language, region or country. ICU's collation is based on the \
Unicode Collation Algorithm plus locale-specific comparison rules from the \
Common Locale Data Repository, a comprehensive source for this type of data.
* Formatting: Format numbers, dates, times and currency amounts according the \
conventions of a chosen locale. This includes translating month and day names \
into the selected language, choosing appropriate abbreviations, ordering \
fields correctly, etc. This data also comes from the Common Locale Data \
Repository.
* Time Calculations: Multiple types of calendars are provided beyond the \
traditional Gregorian calendar. A thorough set of timezone calculation APIs \
are provided.
* Unicode Support: ICU closely tracks the Unicode standard, providing easy \
access to all of the many Unicode character properties, Unicode Normalization, \
Case Folding and other fundamental operations as specified by the Unicode \
Standard.
* Regular Expression: ICU's regular expressions fully support Unicode while \
providing very competitive performance.
* Bidi: support for handling text containing a mixture of left to right \
(English) and right to left (Arabic or Hebrew) data.
* Text Boundaries: Locate the positions of words, sentences, paragraphs within \
a range of text, or identify locations that would be suitable for line \
wrapping when displaying the text.
