SUMMARY="Postmodern immutable and persistent data structures for C++"
DESCRIPTION="lager is a C++ library to assist value-oriented design by implementing the \
unidirectional data-flow architecture. It is heavily inspired by Elm and Redux, and enables \
composable designs by promoting the use of simple value types and testable application logic \
via pure functions. And you get time-travel for free!lager is a C++ library to assist \
