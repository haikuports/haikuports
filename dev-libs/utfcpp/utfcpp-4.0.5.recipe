SUMMARY="UTF-8 with C++ in a Portable Way"
DESCRIPTION="C++ developers still miss an easy and portable way of handling Unicode encoded \
strings. The original C++ standard (known as C++98 or C++03) is Unicode agnostic. Some progress \
has been made in the later editions of the standard, but it is still hard to work with Unicode \
using only the standard facilities.

I came up with a small, C++98 compatible generic library in order to handle UTF-8 encoded strings. \
For anybody used to work with STL algorithms and iterators, it should be easy and natural to use. \
The code is freely available for any purpose - check out the [license](./LICENSE). The library has \
been used a lot since the first release in 2006 both in commercial and open-source projects and \
proved to be stable and useful."
