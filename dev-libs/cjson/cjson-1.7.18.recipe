SUMMARY="Ultralightweight JSON parser in ANSI C"
DESCRIPTION="cJSON aims to be the dumbest possible parser that you can get your job done with. \
It's a single file of C, and a single header file.

JSON is described best here: http://www.json.org/
It's like XML, but fat-free. You use it to move data around, store things, or just generally \
represent your program's state.

As a library, cJSON exists to take away as much legwork as it can, but not get in your way. As a \
point of pragmatism (i.e. ignoring the truth), I'm going to say that you can use it in one of \
two modes: Auto and Manual. Let's have a quick run-through.

I lifted some JSON from this page: http://www.json.org/fatfree.html That page inspired me to \
write cJSON, which is a parser that tries to share the same philosophy as JSON itself. Simple, \
dumb, out of the way."
