SUMMARY="Transducers for C++"
DESCRIPTION="zug is a C++ library providing transducers. Transducers are composable sequential \
transformations independent of the source. They are extremely lightweight, and can be used to \
express algorithms over pull-based sequences (iterators, files) but also push based sequences \
(signals, events, asynchronous streams) in a generic way."
