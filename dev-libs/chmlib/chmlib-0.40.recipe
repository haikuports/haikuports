SUMMARY="A library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files"
DESCRIPTION="chmlib is a small library designed for accessing MS ITSS files. \
The ITSS file format is used for Microsoft Html Help files (.chm), which have \
been the predominant medium for software documentation from Microsoft during \
the past several years, having superceded the previously used .hlp file format.
Note that this is NOT the same as the OLE structured storage file format used \
by MS Excel, Word, and so on.  Instead, it is a different file format which \
fulfills a similar purpose.  Both file formats may be accessed via instances \
of the IStorage COM interface, which is essentially an \"acts like a \
filesystem\" interface."
