SUMMARY="Full-strength general purpose cryptography library (with SSL/TLS)"
DESCRIPTION="The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a \
robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing \
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) \
protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The \
project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the \
Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related \
documentation.
OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young \
and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style \
licence, which basically means that you are free to get and use it for \
commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple license \
conditions."
