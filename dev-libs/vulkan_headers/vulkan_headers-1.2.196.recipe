SUMMARY="Header files for Vulkan graphics API"
DESCRIPTION="vulkan_headersâ„¢ (Vulkan graphics API) is a low-level \
cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API. Vulkan is an explicit API, \
enabling direct control over how GPUs actually work. As such, Vulkan \
supports systems that have multiple GPUs, each running with a different \
driver, or ICD (Installable Client Driver). Vulkan also supports multiple \
global contexts (instances, in Vulkan terminology). The ICD loader is a \
library that is placed between a Vulkan application and any number of \
Vulkan drivers, in order to support multiple drivers and the instance-level \
functionality that works across these drivers. Additionally, the loader \
manages inserting Vulkan layer libraries, such as validation layers, between \
an application and the drivers."
