SUMMARY="A generic C framework developed and used by the Icecast project"
DESCRIPTION="libigloo is a new generic C framework for the Icecast project.

It should replace the code their existing projects share currently (known as “common/”) over time. \
It will both provide a more uniform as well as clean, and modern interface to their shared code \
base."
