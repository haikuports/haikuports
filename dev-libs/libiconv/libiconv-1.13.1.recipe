SUMMARY="The GNU iconv implementation to convert text encodings"
SUMMARY_devel="The libiconv development files"
DESCRIPTION="
For historical reasons, international text is often encoded using a language \
or country dependent character encoding. With the advent of the internet and \
the frequent exchange of text across countries - even the viewing of a web \
page from a foreign country is a \"text exchange\" in this context -, \
conversions between these encodings have become important.
They have also become a problem, because many characters which are present \
in one encoding are absent in many other encodings. To solve this mess, the \
Unicode encoding has been created. It is a super-encoding of all others and \
is therefore the default encoding for new text formats like XML.

Still, many computers still operate in locale with a traditional (limited) \
character encoding. Some programs, like mailers and web browsers, must be able \
to convert between a given text encoding and the user's encoding. Other \
programs internally store strings in Unicode, to facilitate internal \
processing, and need to convert between internal string representation \
(Unicode) and external string representation (a traditional encoding) when \
they are doing I/O. GNU libiconv is a conversion library for both kinds of \
applications.

This library provides an iconv() implementation, for use on systems which \
don't have one, or whose implementation cannot convert from/to Unicode.
It provides support for these encodings:

European languages
- ASCII, ISO-8859-{1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,14,15,16}, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, KOI8-RU, \
CP{1250,1251,1252,1253,1254,1257}, CP{850,866,1131}, \
Mac{Roman,CentralEurope,Iceland,Croatian,Romania}, \
Mac{Cyrillic,Ukraine,Greek,Turkish}, Macintosh
Semitic languages
- ISO-8859-{6,8}, CP{1255,1256}, CP862, Mac{Hebrew,Arabic}
Japanese
- EUC-JP, SHIFT_JIS, CP932, ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-2, ISO-2022-JP-1
Chinese
- EUC-CN, HZ, GBK, CP936, GB18030, EUC-TW, BIG5, CP950, BIG5-HKSCS, \
BIG5-HKSCS:2004, BIG5-HKSCS:2001, BIG5-HKSCS:1999, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-CN-EXT
Korean
- EUC-KR, CP949, ISO-2022-KR, JOHAB
Armenian
- ARMSCII-8
Georgian
- Georgian-Academy, Georgian-PS
Tajik
- KOI8-T
Kazakh
- PT154, RK1048
Thai
- ISO-8859-11, TIS-620, CP874, MacThai
Laotian
- MuleLao-1, CP1133
Vietnamese
- VISCII, TCVN, CP1258
Platform specifics
- HP-ROMAN8, NEXTSTEP
Full Unicode
- UTF-8
- UCS-2, UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE
- UCS-4, UCS-4BE, UCS-4LE
- UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE
- UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE
- UTF-7
- C99, JAVA
Full Unicode, in terms of uint16_t or uint32_t (with machine dependent \
endianness and alignment)
- UCS-2-INTERNAL, UCS-4-INTERNAL
Locale dependent, in terms of 'char' or 'wchar_t' (with machine dependent \
endianness and alignment, and with OS and locale dependent semantics)
- char, wchar_t
- The empty encoding name \"\" is equivalent to \"char\": it denotes the \
locale dependent character encoding.

When configured with the option --enable-extra-encodings, it also provides \
support for a few extra encodings:
European languages
- CP{437,737,775,852,853,855,857,858,860,861,863,865,869,1125}
Semitic languages
- CP864
Japanese
- EUC-JISX0213, Shift_JISX0213, ISO-2022-JP-3
Chinese
- BIG5-2003 (experimental)
Turkmen
- TDS565
Platform specifics
- ATARIST, RISCOS-LATIN1

It can convert from any of these encodings to any other, through Unicode \
conversion.
It has also some limited support for transliteration, i.e. when a character \
cannot be represented in the target character set, it can be approximated \
through one or several similarly looking characters. Transliteration is \
activated when \"//TRANSLIT\" is appended to the target encoding name.

libiconv is for you if your application needs to support multiple character \
encodings, but that support lacks from your system."
