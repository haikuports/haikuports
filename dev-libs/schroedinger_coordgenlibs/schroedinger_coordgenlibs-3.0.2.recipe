SUMMARY="Schrodinger-developed 2D Coordinate Generation"
DESCRIPTION="This is Schrödinger, Inc's 2D coordinate generation. It was formerly proprietary \
code, but is now released under the BSD license. The emphasis of these algorithms are on quality \
of 2D coordinates rather than speed of generation. The algorithm distinguishes itself from many \
others by doing well with both macrocycles and metal complexes. It also does extremely well on \
typical drug-like small molecules, and has been validated on millions of compounds.

Schrodinger intends to continue to contribute to this code as it still uses it inside its \
products, but will also be happy if others contribute pull-requests when there are improvements \
they would like to make. We'll also be happy to hear bug reports or feature requests from use of \
this code, though make no guarantee on our ability to process these."
