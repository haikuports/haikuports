SUMMARY="A fast JSON parser/generator for C++ with both SAX/DOM style API"
DESCRIPTION="RapidJSON is a JSON parser and generator for C++. It was \
inspired by RapidXml.

RapidJSON is small but complete. It supports both SAX and DOM style API. The \
SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code.

RapidJSON is fast. Its performance can be comparable to strlen(). It also \
optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.

RapidJSON is self-contained and header-only. It does not depend on external \
libraries such as BOOST. It even does not depend on STL.

RapidJSON is memory-friendly. Each JSON value occupies exactly 16 bytes for \
most 32/64-bit machines (excluding text string). By default it uses a fast \
memory allocator, and the parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.

RapidJSON is Unicode-friendly. It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (LE & BE), \
and their detection, validation and transcoding internally. For example, you \
can read a UTF-8 file and let RapidJSON transcode the JSON strings into \
UTF-16 in the DOM. It also supports surrogates and \"\u0000\" \
(null character)."
