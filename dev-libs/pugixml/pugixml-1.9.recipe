SUMMARY="An XML processing library"
DESCRIPTION="Pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a \
DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an \
extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML \
file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree \
queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface \
variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which \
happen automatically during parsing/saving)."
