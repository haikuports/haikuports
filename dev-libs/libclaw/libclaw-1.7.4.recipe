SUMMARY="Absolutely Wonderful C++ Library"
DESCRIPTION="
Claw is a generalist library written in C++ and providing various structures
and algorithms, like containers, string algorithms, tweeners, BÃ©zier curves and
more.

The story of Claw begins when I wanted to group all the small tools I have made
along my studies at the university. The library progress from time to time,
mostly when I need a new tool for Plee the Bear, a game I am actively working
on.

Claw wants to be standard compliant and as portable as possible. Of course,
because I'm currently the only developer, the task is a little bit difficult
and you could have some minor problems. If you experience any problem, please
let me know by contacting me.

Claw stands for \"C++ Library Absolutely Wonderful\".
