SUMMARY="Library for Interfacing with HID-Class devices"
DESCRIPTION="HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to \
interface with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, and \
macOS. While it can be used to communicate with standard HID devices like \
keyboards, mice, and Joysticks, it is most useful when used with custom \
(Vendor-Defined) HID devices. Many devices do this in order to not require a \
custom driver to be written for each platform. HIDAPI is easy to integrate with \
the client application, just requiring a single source file to be dropped into \
the application. (On Haiku, it only works with USB)."
