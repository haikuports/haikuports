SUMMARY="Simple set of classes for developing HTTP server applications in Qt"
DESCRIPTION="The design goals of QHttpEngine include:

* Reliability - extremely exhaustive test suite ensures that bugs are caught \
as soon as they are introduced
* Flexibility - classes are designed for easy integration with existing Qt code
* Simplicity - everything is intentionally kept as simple as possible
* Usability - documentation is provided for all classes

All of QHttpEngine's functionality is included in a single monolithic library."
