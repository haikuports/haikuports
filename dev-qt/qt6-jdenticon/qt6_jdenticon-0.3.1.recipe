SUMMARY="Qt6 / C++14 Port of Jdenticon"
DESCRIPTION="This is the initial Qt5 port of jdenticon https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon

Not all of the features are currently implemented, and there may be bugs in various places.  It \
also does not have a proper build other than via qmake / Qt Creator.  Consider this a Work In \
Progress at the moment.

The eventual plan for this is that it will be made into a Qt5 library that can be used in other \
applications with a command-line application for use as a standalone generator.

In order to generate new jdenticon's, the main function in qtidenticon.cpp must be modified. \
The program does not yet support command line arguments that allow the input of the text to be \
jdenticon-ified."
