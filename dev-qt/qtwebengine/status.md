This is the Haiku project for porting QtWebEngine to the Haiku operating system.

Much of the original QtWebEngine 5.11.1 patching was done by Kappix to get a solid compile,
but the port currently crashes. ThreeDeyes and many others handle the grunt work on the entire Qt5 port.

I, CocoBean, started working on QtWebEngine mainly to port the new release of a KDE feature-rich browser - Falkon.
Falkon is a KDE web browser using the QtWebEngine rendering engine, previously known as QupZilla.
It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms. 

This provides Haiku with a Chromium backend to support future web browser projects. For more about
Chromium, see: https://www.chromium.org

The quest continues....
