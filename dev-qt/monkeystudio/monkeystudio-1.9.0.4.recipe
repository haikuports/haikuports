SUMMARY="A cross platform IDE written in C++/Qt 4"
DESCRIPTION="MonkeyStudio's primary goal was to be a Qt 4 only IDE, but it \
evolved to be a way to support any kind of project. It supports Qt 4 \
project management and embeds Designer and Assistant to form a complete, \
fast and powerful Qt-based IDE. It's based upon a flexible plugin system \
that allows extending it in a near-infinite manner.

Among MonkeyStudio's features:

- Advanced, customizable code editor, based on QScintilla.
- Syntax highlighting for more than 22 programming languages.
- Automatic detection of End Of Line mode (∕n, ∕r∕n). You can work with \
files that have Windows/Unix EOL symbols at the same time and save its \
original mode.
- Automatic detection of indentation mode. Choose your preferred mode, or \
activate automatic detection to save the original indentation of your files.
- Templates wizard allows you to create files or projects from templates, \
provided by the MkS Team, or from your own templates.
- With code restyling you can quickly fix/update the style of your code \
using embedded AStyle code beautifier.
- Automatic completion based on contents of the current file, or on .api \
files for your language/libraries if available.
- Search and replace engine allows you to search and replace text in the \
current file, or in a directory.
- Navigator shows a list of classes, methods, functions, variables... in \
the file and allows you to jump to the line in the code where the object \
is located. Navigation based on Exuberant Ctags supports 31 programming \
languages."
