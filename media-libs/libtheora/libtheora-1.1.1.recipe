SUMMARY="Theora video compression format library"
DESCRIPTION="Theora is a free and open video compression format from the \
Xiph.org Foundation. Like all Xiph.org media technology it can be used to \
distribute film and video online and on disc without the licensing and \
royalty fees or vendor lock-in associated with other formats.

Theora scales from postage stamp to HD resolution, and is considered \
particularly competitive at low bitrates. It is in the same class as \
MPEG-4/DiVX, and like the Vorbis audio codec it has lots of room for \
improvement as encoder technology develops.

Theora is in full public release as of November 3, 2008. The bitstream format \
for Theora I was frozen Thursday, 2004 July 1. All bitstreams encoded since \
that date will remain compatible with future releases."
