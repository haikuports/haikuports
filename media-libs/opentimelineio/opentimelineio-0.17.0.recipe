SUMMARY="Open Source API and interchange format for editorial timeline information"
DESCRIPTION="OpenTimelineIO is an interchange format and API for editorial cut information. OTIO \
contains information about the order and length of cuts and references to external media. It is \
not however, a container format for media.

For integration with applications, the core OTIO library is implemented in C++ and provides an \
in-memory data model, as well as library functions for interpreting, manipulating, and \
serializing that data model. Within the core is a dependency-less library for dealing strictly \
with time, *opentime*.

The project also supports an official python binding, which is intended to be an idiomatic and \
ergonomic binding for python developers.  The python binding includes a plugin system which \
supports a number of different types of plugins, most notably adapters, which can be used to \
read and write legacy formats into the OTIO data model."
