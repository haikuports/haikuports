Note: this license is substantially different than the license for other
products of PDFlib GmbH. This license does not cover products other than those
mentioned in section 1.

1. Definitions
-----------------------------------------------------------
This agreement defines the licensing terms for the software product called
PDFlib Lite 5.0.3. This product will be referred to as »the program« in this
agreement. The program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by the
licensor.

The program is delivered with a digital manual which describes its programming
features and their usage (»the documentation«).
»Programming samples« shall mean the sample code which demonstrates use of the
program, and which is part of the distribution.
»Original distribution» shall mean the set of all files comprising the source
code package for the program as made available by licensor.

The term »integrated product« shall be used in this agreement to designate any
product that is made up of both the program and software or hardware developed
or marketed by any other individual or organization. Integrated product shall
mean all components which are required to make reasonable use of the aggregate
software, even if such components are not directly attached to the program. For
example, if integrated product is a virtual printer driver integrated product
means the complete operating system; if integrated product is a word processor
integrated product means the full word processor plus auxiliary components;
if integrated product is a Web application integrated product means all
components for retrieving, processing, and presenting data. (This is not an
exhaustive enumeration.)

By using, modifying or distributing the program (or any work based on the
program), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all
its terms and conditions for using, copying, distributing or modifying the
program or works based on it. Nothing other than this license grants you
permission to use, modify or distribute the program or its derivative works.
These actions are prohibited by law. If you do not accept these terms and
conditions, do not use, modify or distribute the program.

2. Using the Program
-----------------------------------------------------------
Functional use (running) of the program requires a commercial license which
is outside the scope of this agreement. However, exempt users listed below
are granted a world-wide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to use the
program.

### 2.1 Open Source Developer Exemption

Use of the program as part of an integrated product is exempt from commercial
licensing provided the integrated product is available under a license which
has been approved by the Open Source Initiative OSI (www.opensource.org),
complete source code for the integrated product is available to anyone free
of charge, and the availability of source code is announced on a publicly
accessible Web site. Source code means the preferred machine-readable form
in which a programmer would modify the software.

### 2.2 Private non-Profit User Exemption

Non-profit uses of the program by a private individual are exempt from
commercial licensing. For-profit use by individuals and non-profit use by
organizations do not fall under this exemption.

### 2.3 Educational and Research Exemption

Use of the program by educational institutions and individuals for
educational and research purposes is exempt from commercial licensing.
Other uses (e.g., administrative) by educational institutions do not fall
under this exemption.

3. Redistribution
-----------------------------------------------------------
Redistribution in binary or source form by a commercial organization to any
third party are permitted provided that all of the following conditions are
met. Redistributing the program under these conditions does not necessarily
give the recipient the right to use the program; using the program is always
subject to the conditions in section 2.

### 3.1 Modifications

If you have modified the program, you must include prominent notices in
stating that you have modified the program’s files, your name, your e-mail
address (if any) and the date and purpose of any change.

PDF files generated with the program must include the same Producer entry in
the document info field as those generated with the original (unmodified)
program. Changing the Producer entry renders this license invalid.

### 3.2 Source Code Redistribution

Redistributions of source code must include all files which are part of the
original distribution. Omitting one or more files would result in a
distribution which is not compliant with this license.

### 3.3 Binary Redistribution

Redistributions in binary (compiled) form must include this license, the
documentation, and programming samples. Not all programming samples must be
included, but only the samples for programming languages which are actually
supported by the binary distribution. As an alternative to including the
documentation in a binary distribution, the documentation may also be made
available separately for free download on the Internet in unmodified form.
This »download« exception does not apply to other files which are part of
the original distribution.

4. Reservation of Rights
-----------------------------------------------------------

No rights are granted to the program except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not use, copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program except
as expressly provided under this license. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this license.

5. Warranty
-----------------------------------------------------------
The program is provided to you »as is«, without warranty. There is no
warranty for the program, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose and non-infringement of third party rights. The entire
risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should
the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will
licensor, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the program
as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or
inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or
data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties
or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if
such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

6. General
-----------------------------------------------------------
This license is governed by the laws of Germany, excluding choice of law
rules. If any part of this license is found to be in conflict with the law,
that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the
law, and no other parts of the license shall be affected.
