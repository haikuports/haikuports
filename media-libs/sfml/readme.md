Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide
a simple application programming interface (API) to various multimedia components in computers. It is written
in C++ with bindings available for C, Crystal, D, Euphoria, Go, Java, Julia, .NET, Nim, OCaml, Python, Ruby, and Rust

SFML consists of various modules:

    System – vector and Unicode string classes, portable threading and timer facilities
    Window – window and input device management including support for joysticks, OpenGL context management
    Graphics – hardware acceleration of 2D graphics including sprites, polygons and text rendering
    Audio – hardware-accelerated spatialised audio playback and recording
    Network – TCP and UDP network sockets, data encapsulation facilities, HTTP and FTP classes

While the graphics module is one of the main features of SFML, developers who are interested in only creating an environment to program directly
in OpenGL can do so by using the Window module on its own without the graphics module. 

Similarly, the other modules can also be used independently of each other, except for the System module which is used by all of the modules.
