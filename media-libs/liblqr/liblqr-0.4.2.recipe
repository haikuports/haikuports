SUMMARY="An easy to use C/C++ seam carving library"
DESCRIPTION="The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts them \
to a multi-size representation.

Following is a list of features:

* Easy to use and fully documented API
* Supports color depths from 8 bits per channel to 64 bits per channel
* Support for different color models: grayscale, RGB, CMY and their variants, and even custom ones
* Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard, or for additional seam rigidity
* Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done in real-time. In fact, the \
information can be saved and read out later without any further processing
* The resizing is done with a single function which automatically performs all the necessary \
operations; it can also work in successive steps without wasting computational time
* Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be less connected, or more rigid, \
or both (the rigidity can be modulated on a local basis)
* Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
* Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process as the parent image
* The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by selecting among different \
energy functions, and easily defining cusom ones
* Reports progress through a customizable interface
* A signalling system permits to handle errors cleanly
* Portable to all major OS's"
