SUMMARY="A library for processing GIFs"
DESCRIPTION="The GIFLIB project maintains the giflib service library, which \
has been pulling images out of GIFs since 1989. It is deployed everywhere you \
can think of and some places you probably can't - graphics applications and \
web browsers on multiple operating systems, game consoles, smartphones, and \
likely your ATM too.

This is very mature, stable, small-footprint code with minimal dependencies \
(suitable for use in embedded deployments) that needs only occasional very \
minor bugfixes. Test reports from odd platforms and better regression tests \
are particularly welcome. Don't try to redesign it, applications beyond \
counting would break if you did.

It's \"GIFLIB\" in caps as a nod to the code's origins in the dark and \
backward abysm of MS-DOS, but Unix hackers are encouraged to spell it \
\"giflib\" in deference to local conventions. :-)"
