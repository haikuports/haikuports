SUMMARY="Scaling, colorspace conversion, and dithering library"
DESCRIPTION="The "z" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of scaling, \
colorspace conversion, and depth conversion. A simple API enables conversion between any supported \
formats to operate with minimal knowledge from the programmer.
All library routines were designed from the ground-up with correctness, flexibility, and \
thread-safety as first priorities.
Allocation, buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing, allowing the programmer to \
adapt /"z/" to many scenarios."
