SUMMARY="A library for encoding and decoding WebP image files"
DESCRIPTION="WebP is an image format that provides lossless and lossy \
compression for images on the web. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller \
in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size \
compared to JPEG images at equivalent SSIM index.
WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as alpha channel) with \
just 22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported with lossy \
compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared to \
PNG when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color \
channels."
