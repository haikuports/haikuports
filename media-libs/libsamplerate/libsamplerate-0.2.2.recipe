SUMMARY="Samplerate converter for audio"
DESCRIPTION="Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a samplerate \
converter for audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is \
converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz sample rate \
used by DAT players.

SRC is capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions, from downsampling \
by a factor of 256 to upsampling by the same factor. Arbitrary in this case \
means that the ratio of input and output sample rates can be an irrational \
number. The conversion ratio can also vary with time for speeding up and \
slowing down effects."
