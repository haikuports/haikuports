SUMMARY="The interactive audio codec Opus"
DESCRIPTION="Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio \
codec. Opus is unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over \
the Internet, but is also intended for storage and streaming applications. \
It is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 \
which incorporated technology from Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT \
codec.

Opus can handle a wide range of audio applications, including Voice over IP, \
videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music performances. It \
can scale from low bitrate narrowband speech to very high quality stereo \
music.

Supported features are:

* Bitrates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
* Sampling rates from 8 kHz (narrowband) to 48 kHz (fullband)
* Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
* Support for both constant bitrate (CBR) and variable bitrate (VBR)
* Audio bandwidth from narrowband to fullband
* Support for speech and music
* Support for mono and stereo
* Support for up to 255 channels (multistream frames)
* Dynamically adjustable bitrate, audio bandwidth, and frame size
* Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)
* Floating point and fixed-point implementation"
