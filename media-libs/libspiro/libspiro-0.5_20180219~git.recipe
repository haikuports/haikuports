SUMMARY="A library that simplifies the drawing of beautiful curves"
DESCRIPTION="LibSpiro is a shared library designed to give programs the \
ability to create smooth continuous curves based on a given set of codes and \
X,Y constraints.

The main user(s) of Libspiro are Font editing programs such as FontForge, and \
forked copies have been seen in more artistic programs such as InkScape, or \
in libraries such as GEGL. There may be other possible uses in future, and \
this library has strong potential in graphical and vector type programs."
