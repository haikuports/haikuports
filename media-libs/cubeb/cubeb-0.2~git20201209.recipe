SUMMARY="Cross platform audio library"
DESCRIPTION="Cubeb is a cross-platform library, written in C/C++, that was \
created and has been maintained by the Firefox Media Team.
The functionality of the library is not limited to audio input and output. \
In addition, it is possible to enumerate all audio devices in the system, as \
well as to register notifications such as device unplugs. It is also possible \
to switch between devices at a lower level with a minimal transition gap."
