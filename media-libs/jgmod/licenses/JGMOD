JGMOD library 0.99
8 October 2002

What is JGMOD ??
----------------
JGMOD is a mod library for MOD musics. It is built on top of Allegro lower
level digital sound routines. Currently supports MOD, S3M, XM, Unreal
S3M (in UMX extension), and JGM under DJGPP, Mingw32, MSVC, Linux and BEOS.

JG stands for Jeffery Guan. So figure out yourself what JGMOD stands for.

I am doing this library for 4 main reasons.
1.  For the sake of learning. I always wanted to learn how to do a mod
    player.
2.  I am tired of using Mikmod. I have to initialise a lot of things
    just to make speakers rock.
3.  There are no mod library specifically for Allegro yet before JGMOD. 
4.  It is kinda great to make a MOD library. :-)

Whats new in this version
-------------------------
1. JGMOD "save_sample" function is having conflict with Allegro
   WIP 4.12 "save_sample" function. Fixed
2. Change the default optimization from 486 to Pentium machines (should
   have done this a long time ago)

To do list

About JGMOD.EXE
---------------
I use these programs to test the musics that I have. You should see the
numbers below similar.  Well, let me explain what these numbers are.

1:  4  1 15678Hz 255        
2:  2 11 18363Hz   0
3: 60 32 32567Hz 127
4: -- -- -----Hz ---
5: 45 64 45678Hz  34
6:  7 34   911Hz 204

Column 1 : Channel no.
Column 2 : Sample it is currently playing beginning with 1 as the first
           sample.
Column 3 : Volume. 0 to 64 scale.
Column 4 : Frequency of the sample that is being played (in hertz)
Column 5 : Panning. 0, left most panning. 255, right most panning. 127, center
           panning.

On the right sight of these text, you will see colored circles. The position
of the circle tells you the pitch (without the c2spd). The more right it goes,
the higher the pitch. The circles comes in different sizes. The bigger
it is, the louder the sample is played at. And when the circle changes
colour, it means a different sample is used. I find this is a much better
way than looking the hertz values in column 4 especially on mods with lots of
channels (eg 32 channels). Then watching those hertz values could make me
really dizzy.

Keys
----
P           : Pause/unpause music
R           : restart music
N           : Disable/Enable note dots
+/-         : Increase/Decrease mod volume
Left/right  : Previous/next pattern
Up/Down     : Scroll channel up/down (if more than 33 channels are used)
F1/F2       : Decrease/increase mod speed
F3/F4       : Decrease/increase mod pitch
F5/F6       : Decrease/increase note range
F7/F8       : Decrease/increase note relative positon
Space / Esc : Exit

Words from me
-------------
Thanks for downloading this library. If you have any questions you want to
ask, bug reports or just want to say something, just send a mail to
me (jgfw@hotpop.com).

When you found a bug, please don't hesitate to send it to me. JGMOD is not
a bug free program. There are a certain bugs that I am not aware of but
you do. Chances are that I will never encounter those bugs which means that
they will not get fixed. You might have found more bugs than I do. So don't
hesitate and I will see what I can do.

You can send the mail to Allegro Mailing list too. If you do, please
put a MOD capitalized as the subject just to catch my attention. 
I will only read interesting mails. The rest, I just skip and then delete
it. So, I might accidently skip yours.

Jean-Paul Mikkers
    For creating Mikmod. You have never answered any of my mails. I don't
    know why. I got some ideas on loading mod from your codes. So thanks
    anyway

Jake Stine
    For maintaining Mikmod 3.0x. You have improved the codes for loading
    mods over Mikmod 2.10 which provides a great help to me when coding
    the MOD loaders.
