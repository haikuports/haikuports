SUMMARY="Ogg multimedia container format library"
DESCRIPTION="
Ogg is a multimedia container format, and the native file and stream format \
for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs. As with all Xiph.org technology is it an \
open format free for anyone to use.
As with most container formats it encapsulates raw compressed data and allows \
the interleaving of audio and video data inside a single convenient format. \
Other examples of container formats are Quicktime .mov, the MPEG program \
stream, and AVI.

In addition to encapsulation and interleave of multiple data streams, Ogg \
provides packet framing, error detection, and periodic timestamps for seeking, \
all in a small, bounded percentage bitrate overhead.
Ogg is a stream oriented container, meaning it can be written and read in one \
pass, making it a natural fit for internet streaming and use in processing \
pipelines. This stream orientation is the major design difference over other \
file-based container formats.
