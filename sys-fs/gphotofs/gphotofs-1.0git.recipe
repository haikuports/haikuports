SUMMARY="A command-line frontend to libgphoto2"
DESCRIPTION="gGPhotoFS is a filesystem client based on libgphoto2 that \
exposes supported cameras as filesystems; while some cameras implement the \
USB Mass Storage class and already appear as filesystems (making \
this program redundant), many use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) \
or some other custom protocol. But as long as the camera is supported \
by libgphoto2, it can be mounted as a filesystem using this program.

As libgphoto2 is a userspace library for interacting with cameras, \
it is natural that if one is to build a filesystem ontop of it, one \
should use FUSE, and that is what I have done."
