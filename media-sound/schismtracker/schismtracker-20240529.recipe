SUMMARY="Free reimplementation of Impulse Tracker"
DESCRIPTION="Schism Tracker is a free reimplementation of Impulse Tracker, a \
program used to create high quality music without the requirements of \
specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique \"finger feel\" that is \
difficult to replicate in part. The player is based on a highly modified \
version of the Modplug engine, with a number of bugfixes and changes to \
improve IT playback.

Where Impulse Tracker was limited to i386-based systems running MS-DOS, Schism \
Tracker runs on almost any platform that SDL supports, and has been \
successfully built for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, FreeBSD, AmigaOS, BeOS, and \
even the Wii. Most development is currently done on 64-bit Linux. Schism will \
most likely build on any architecture supported by GCC4 (e.g. alpha, m68k, \
arm, etc.) but it will probably not be as well-optimized on many systems."
