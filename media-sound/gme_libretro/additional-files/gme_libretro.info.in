description = "A port of blargg's classic Game Music Emu to libretro. This core allows playback of a wide variety of video game music formats and is a good first choice for this purpose, though some emulator cores will also support playback of their respective native formats and may do so with additional options (low-pass filtering, etc.) or accuracy."
