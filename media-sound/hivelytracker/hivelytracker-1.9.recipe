SUMMARY="A tracker program based upon the AHX format"
DESCRIPTION="HivelyTracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format \
created in the mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively \
popular, and many songs were created and used in scene productions and games. \
AHX was designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.

HivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX format, \
but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has its own \
instrument and module formats."
