SUMMARY="A tracker program based upon the AHX format"
DESCRIPTION="
Hively Tracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in the \
mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively popular, and \
many songs were created and used in scene productions and games. AHX was \
designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.
HivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX format, \
but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has its own \
instrument and module formats."
