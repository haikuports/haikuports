SUMMARY="A lightweight static music DSP library"
DESCRIPTION="Soundpipe is a lightweight music DSP library for musicians \
and creative coders. It exists to bring beautiful sounds to your projects. \
The Soundpipe library is built up of over 100 (and counting!) high quality \
modules, many of which have been ported directly from the time-honored Csound \
synthesis language. These modules can be combined together to build unique sounds."
