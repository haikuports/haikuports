SUMMARY="Lossless mp3 normalizer with statistical analysis"
DESCRIPTION="MP3Gain analyzes and adjusts mp3 files so that they have the same \
volume. MP3Gain does not just do peak normalization, as many normalizers do. \
Instead, it does some statistical analysis (using the replaygain algorithm)to \
determine how loud the file actually sounds to the human ear.
MP3Gain can adjust the volume in a completely lossless way by modifying the mp3 \
file directly, without decoding and re-encoding. This works with all mp3 \
players, i.e. no support for a special tag is required."
