SUMMARY="Cross-platform music production software"
DESCRIPTION="LMMS is a free cross-platform alternative to commercial \
programs like FL StudioÂ®, which allow you to produce music with your \
computer. This includes the creation of melodies and beats, the \
synthesis and mixing of sounds, and arranging of samples. You can have fun \
with your MIDI-keyboard and much more; all in a user-friendly and modern \
interface."
