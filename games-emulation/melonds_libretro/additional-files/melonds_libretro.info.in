description = "A port of the melonDS emulator to libretro. This core supports a variety of modern features, like hardware-accelerated internal res increases, as well as increased accuracy for some popular games. While not as mature as Desmume--and therefore not as compatible with the DS library as a whole--this core is a good first choice to try, with the Desmume core(s) as a fallback."
