description = "FCEUmm libretro is based on the FCEUmm (mappers modified) fork of the FCEU emulator. It is very fast and supports many mappers, including those for weird, obscure bootleg carts. It is tightly integrated with libretro features, which makes it a good choice for users seeking advanced frontend functionality, such as runahead and rollback netplay. While most NES emulators are lightweight, FCEUmm's particularly low resource requirements make it a good option for mobile, low-power/embedded and console targets."
