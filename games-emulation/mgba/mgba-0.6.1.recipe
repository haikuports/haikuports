SUMMARY="A new Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance emulator written in C"
DESCRIPTION="mGBA is a new generation of Game Boy Advance emulator. The project \
started in April 2013 with the goal of being fast enough to run on lower end \
hardware than other emulators support, without sacrificing accuracy or \
portability. Even in the initial version, games generally played without \
problems. mGBA has only gotten better since then, and now boasts being the \
most accurate GBA emulator around.

Other goals include accurate enough emulation to provide a development \
environment for homebrew software, a good workflow for tool-assist runners, \
and a modern feature set for emulators that older emulators may not support."

# If you have come here to upgrade mGBA to use SDL2, know this:
# Haiku's SDL2 port is (at time of writing) TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE with
# Qt and cannot be run in the same binary as it, as both create
# BApplication objects independent of the other.
# SDL1.2 checks if one already exists first, so it's OK.
