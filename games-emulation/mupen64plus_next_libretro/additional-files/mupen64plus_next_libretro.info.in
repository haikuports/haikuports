description = "An up-to-date port of the Mupen64Plus N64 emulator, ported to libretro. It uses up-to-date GLideN64 plugin as its default graphics plug, though the high-accuracy Angrylion and ParaLLEl-RDP plugins are also available. This core is a good first choice for most users and should generally work better than the ParaLLEl-N64 core, which is mainly useful for its support for legacy graphics plugins that can run on older/low-power devices that are too weak for the modern plugins."
