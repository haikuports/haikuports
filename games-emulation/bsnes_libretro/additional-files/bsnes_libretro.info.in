description = "bsnes libretro core is based on the latest source code from the bsnes emulator, which is known for its high accuracy and faithful reproduction of the SNES/SFC console. In addition to high accuracy, this version also includes a number of enhancements, such as mode 7 upscaling and overclocking for the Super FX add-on chip used in Star Fox and other games. This core is a good option for users on desktop platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux) with a relatively fast CPU. While it lacks support for libretro cheats and retro-achievements, it does have its own runahead implementation that is accessible from the core options. This core is not compatible with compressed save files, so be aware of that if you wish to import saves made by another core."
