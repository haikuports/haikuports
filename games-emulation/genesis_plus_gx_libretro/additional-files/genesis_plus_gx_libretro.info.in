description = "A port of the Genesis Plus GX emulator to libretro. Originally designed to run on the Wii console via homebrew, Genesis Plus GX was one of the first cores ported to libretro, and it has always been the first choice for any 8- and 16-bit Sega consoles, from Master System to Game Gear to Genesis/Mega Drive to Sega CD. Only the 32X is not supported. The core is both fast and highly accurate and it benefits from a tight and feature-filled integration with libretro."
