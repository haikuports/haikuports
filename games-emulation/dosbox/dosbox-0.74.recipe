SUMMARY="A DOS-Emulator that uses SDL library"
DESCRIPTION="
DOSBox is a DOS-emulator that uses the SDL-library which makes DOSBox very \
easy to port to different platforms. DOSBox has already been ported to many \
different platforms, such as Windows, BeOS, Linux, MacOS X...
DOSBox also emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory \
FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics, a \
SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound card for excellent sound compatibility with \
older games...
You can re-live the good old days with the help of DOSBox, it can run plenty \
of the old classics that don't run on your new computer!
DOSBox is totally free of charge and OpenSource.
