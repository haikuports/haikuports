description = "A port of the highly accurate Game Boy emulator, SameBoy, to libretro. This core has the highest accuracy of any Game Boy emulator and also supports a variety of fun features and improvements. While its requirements are higher than most other Game Boy cores, it is a good first choice for devices strong enough to run it full speed. Lower-power devices will be better-served by Gambatte-libretro, which still has very high accuracy/compatibility and runs blisteringly fast."
