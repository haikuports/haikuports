description = "A fork of the venerable Game Boy Advance emulator, VisualBoy Advance-Merged, branched off circa 2011, but with some backported patches for improved performance and compatibility. This core runs a bit faster than the up-to-date VBA-M core, but it is based on an older snapshot of the codebase and lacks many years of development and improvements, resulting in compatibility issues with some games (mostly related to a lack of support for the tilt and solar sensors). Most users should start with the up-to-date VBA-M core and only fall back to this one if they need the additional performance boost."
