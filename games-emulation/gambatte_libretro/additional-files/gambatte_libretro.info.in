description = "A port of the Gambatte Game Boy emulator to libretro. One of the very first libretro cores, this core is reasonably accurate (enough to run all but a scant handful of games with no visible bugs) and blisteringly fast. While Gearboy and SameBoy cores have surpassed it in accuracy, Gambatte is still an excellent choice on low-power systems that cannot handle the more-accurate newcomers while maintaining full speed."
