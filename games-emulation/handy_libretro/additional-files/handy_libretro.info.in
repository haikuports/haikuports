description = "A port of the venerable Handy Atari Lynx emulator to libretro. This core provides a solid emulation experience for this console, with support for video rotation, etc. but the hardware's unusual screen refresh rate of 75 Hz means scrolling for this core will always be a bit choppy on more common 60 Hz displays. This core is a good first choice for playing Lynx games via libretro frontends."
