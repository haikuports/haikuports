description = "A fast and portable emulator for many Sega game consoles, ported to libretro. This core is notable for being the only open source emulator to support the 32X add-on. It also has very stable savestates, making it a good choice for features that require them. However, this core has lower accuracy than Genesis Plus GX and BlastEm, so users seeking the highest accuracy on reasonably-powered devices should use those cores instead."
