description = "An older fork of Mednafen's Saturn emulator (with some fixes backported from later versions), this core represents a major step forward for accurate Saturn emulation, and it runs most games with few or no noticeable glitches/anomalies. However, this accuracy comes at the price of high CPU requirements. Additionally, this core is software-rendered and does not support any increases in internal resolution or other fun-but-accuracy-compromising features, unlike the other, less-accurate Saturn cores."
