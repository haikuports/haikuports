description = "An advanced, mature and actively developed Game Boy Advance emulator, ported to libretro. This emulator strives for high accuracy and high performance, and it is generally a good first choice for GBA emulation on any platform where it is available. gpSP is a good fallback on devices that cannot maintain full speed with mGBA."
