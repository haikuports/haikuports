DESCRIPTION="
distcc is a program to distribute builds of C, C++, Objective C or Objective \
C++ code across several machines on a network. distcc should always generate \
the same results as a local build, is simple to install and use, and is \
usually much faster than a local compile.

distcc does not require all machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized \
clocks, or to have the same libraries or header files installed. They can even \
have different processors or operating systems, if cross-compilers are \
installed.
