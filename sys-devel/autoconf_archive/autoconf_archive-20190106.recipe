SUMMARY="A collection of freely re-usable Autoconf macros"
DESCRIPTION="The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 500 macros \
for [GNU Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) that have been \
contributed as free software by friendly supporters of the cause from all \
over the Internet. Every single one of those macros can be re-used without \
imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the generated \
configure script. In particular, it is possible to use all those macros in \
configure scripts that are meant for non-free software. This policy is unusual \
for a Free Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that software \
ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically \
designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be \
free as well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made, \
because Autoconf is at such a pivotal position in the software development \
tool chain that the benefits from having this tool available as widely as \
possible outweigh the disadvantage that some authors may choose to use it, \
too, for proprietary software."
