SUMMARY="Build tool, replacement for make"
DESCRIPTION="
	Jam is a small open-source build tool that can be used as a replacement 
	for Make. Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, it is far 
	more powerful and easy to master. Its design is sufficiently clear to 
	allow any average programmer to extend it with advanced features at will.

	The main differences between Jam and Make are as follows:

	- Jam uses ‘Jamfiles’ instead of ‘Makefiles’.

	- Jamfiles do not normally contain toolset-specific rules or actions. 
	  They are thus portable among distinct compilers.

	- Jamfiles are a lot simpler than Makefiles to write and understand, 
	  while providing the same functionality, and much, much more.
