SUMMARY="Build tool, replacement for make"
DESCRIPTION="Jam is a small open-source build tool that can be used as a \
replacement for Make. Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, \
it is far more powerful and easy to master. Its design is sufficiently \
clear to allow any average programmer to extend it with advanced features \
at will.

The main differences between Jam and Make are:
- Jam uses 'Jamfiles' instead of 'Makefiles'.
- Jamfiles do not normally contain toolset-specific rules or actions. They are \
thus portable among distinct compilers.
- Jamfiles are a lot simpler than Makefiles to write and understand, while \
providing the same functionality, and much, much more."
