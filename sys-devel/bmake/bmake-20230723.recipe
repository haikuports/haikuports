SUMMARY="Portable version of NetBSD make"
DESCRIPTION="Bmake is derived from NetBSD's make(1), its goal is to be a \
portable version of same, so new features are added via imports of NetBSD's \
make (I'm one of the contributors to NetBSD). Thus bmake is kept in sync with \
NetBSD's make.

This version of Make features several extensions that are not in GNU Make, and \
does not has all of GNU Make extensions. Some projects explicitly require one \
or the other."
