SUMMARY="Standard tool to compile source trees"
DESCRIPTION="
	Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
	non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

	Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called
	the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute
	it from other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile
	for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the
	program.
