SUMMARY="Standard tool to compile source trees"
DESCRIPTION="Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and \
other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.
Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the \
makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from \
other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so \
that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program."
