SUMMARY="A quick and light preprocessor, fully compliant with C99"
DESCRIPTION="ucpp is a C preprocessor. It is designed to be quick and light, \
but anyway fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known as C99. \
ucpp can be compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some other code; \
in the latter case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a time, on demand, as an \
integrated lexer."
