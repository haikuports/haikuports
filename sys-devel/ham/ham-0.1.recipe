SUMMARY="Build tool, replacement for jam"
DESCRIPTION="Ham is a a meaty Jam build tool replacement
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT YET READY FOR HAIKUDEPOT
One of the main goals is to have an API library, so that IDEs can implement \
actual Jam support. Another one is to add features that are complicated to add \
in Jam (like more intelligent header scanning, plug-in support (for header \
scanning, archive types), dependence of targets on their actual actions (i.e. \
Jamfile change would trigger rebuild of affected targets)"
