SUMMARY="The GNU macro processor"
DESCRIPTION="GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro \
processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions \
(for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).

M4 is a macro processor in the sense that it copies its input to the output \
expanding macros as it goes. Macros are either builtin or user-defined and can \
take any number of arguments. Besides just doing macro expansion, M4 has \
builtin functions for including named files, running UNIX commands, doing \
integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, recursion, etc. M4 can \
be used either as a front-end to a compiler or as a macro processor in its own \
right.
One of the biggest users of M4 is the GNU Autoconf project."
