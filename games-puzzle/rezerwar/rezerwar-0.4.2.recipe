SUMMARY="A puzzle game"
DESCRIPTION="Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be described as the \
illegitimate child of a known tetromino game and the average pipe game. \
It runs on Linux,  Windows, Nintendo Wii (homebrew), FreeBSD, Amiga OS, And \
Now Haiku!
The whole game was created with open-source software including graphics, \
sounds and musics. Feel free to contribute. The goal of this game is \
basically to create networks of water to make them disappear, a couple tricks \
and techniques will help you achieve this goal faster."
