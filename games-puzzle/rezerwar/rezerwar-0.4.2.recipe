SUMMARY="A puzzle game."
DESCRIPTION="Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be described as the illegitimate child of a  known tetromino game and the average pipe game.
It runs on Linux,  Windows, Nintendo Wii (homebrew), FreeBSD, Amiga OS, And Now Haiku!
The whole game was created with open-source software including graphics, sounds and musics. Feel free to contribute. The  goal of this game is basically to create networks of water to make them disappear, a couple tricks and techniques will help you achieve this goal faster.
