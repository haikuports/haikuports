SUMMARY="Abandoned Bricks is a tetris like cross-platform puzzle game"
DESCRIPTION="The goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score. \
Shapes fall from the top of the screen. You can move them sideways and \
rotate them in order to get the best fit when they reach the bottom. \
When you manage to complete a horizontal line, it disappears. When screen \
is full the game is over. The game speeds up whenever the lines are full. \
Therefore, it's better to fill as many lines you can at once. That way you \
can reach higher levels with the same speed."
