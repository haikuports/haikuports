SUMMARY="Puzzle games based on hexagonal tiles"
DESCRIPTION="Hex-a-Hop is a hexagonal tile-based puzzle game with one simple \
goal: destroy all green tiles! There are infinite undos and no time limits -- \
you just have to find a way to destroy all the green tiles and step on a safe \
tile at the end.

As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are introduced which \
make things more difficult and interesting as you progress through the many \
levels. You can use the infinite undo feature to retrace your steps if you \
make a mistake."
