SUMMARY="A little arcade puzzle game."
DESCRIPTION="The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either horizontally or vertically.\
The only allowed move is the swap of two adjacent monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of three \
or more. When alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the top of the screen to fill the board again. Chain \
reactions earn you even more points."
