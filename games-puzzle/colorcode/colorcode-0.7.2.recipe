SUMMARY="A free advanced MasterMind clone."
DESCRIPTION="ColorCode is a free advanced MasterMind clone with lots of \
different game variants, from the very easy up to really challenging ones. \
You can combine any color count from 2-10 with any column count from 2-5 and \
allow or not pegs of the same color. Or you may select one of the 5 \
predefined levels of difficulty. ColorCode has also a rather intelligent \
built in MasterMind solver - so you can let the computer guess for you \
(nope, he's not cheating - really)."
