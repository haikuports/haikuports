SUMMARY="Beacuse hackers too need to play with balls"
DESCRIPTION="Zaz is a game where the player has to get rid of incoming balls \
by arranging them in triplets. The idea of the game is loosely based on games \
like Luxor, Zuma and Puzzle Bobble. The twists that make Zaz stand out from \
other games of this type are that the balls have to be picked from the path \
(insted of being randomly assigned for the player) and that the player's
\"vehicle\" is also attached to a path which is different from level to level.

But one thing makes this game stand out most from it's predecessors - it's \
free as in freedom ! You are free to download it, free to play it, free to \
modify, love and hate it."
