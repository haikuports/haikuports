SUMMARY="An SDL implementation of the popular puzzle game 'Bejeweled'"
DESCRIPTION="Gemz is an SDL implementation of the popular puzzle game \
'Bejeweled'. The objective of this game is to swap one gem with an adjacent \
gem to form a horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems. Bonus \
points are given when chains of more than three identical gems are formed and \
when two chains are formed in one swap. Gems disappear when chains are formed \
and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions, called \
cascades, are triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems."
