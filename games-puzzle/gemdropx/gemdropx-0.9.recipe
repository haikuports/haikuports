SUMMARY="A fast-paced puzzle game"
DESCRIPTION="Gem Drop X is a fast-paced puzzle game where it is your job to \
clear the screen of gems before they squash you! (You are at the bottom, they \
are at the top, and they keep coming!) \
Gem Drop X was directly ported from the original GemDrop for the Atari 8-bit, \
which was based on \"Magical Drop III\" by SNK. \
You grab gems (up to 10) of the same color and use them to knock more gems \
off the screen. Match 3 or more of the same color in a column and >BAM!< \
they explode! Any adjacent gems of the same color also explode, causing a \
chain reaction that might cover the entire screen! \
The more gems that disappear with one shot, the higher the score you get!"
