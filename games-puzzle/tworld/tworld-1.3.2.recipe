SUMMARY="Emulation of the game Chip's Challenge"
DESCRIPTION="Tile World is an emulation of the game Chip's Challenge. \
Chip's Challenge was originally written for the Atari Lynx by Chuck \
Sommerville, and was later ported to MS Windows by Microsoft (among other \
ports). Chip's Challenge is a game made up of both intellectually engaging \
puzzles and situations demanding fast reflexes. As you might have guessed, \
it is a tile-based game. The object of each level is simply to get out â€” \
i.e., to find and achieve the exit tile. This simple task, however, can \
sometimes be extremely challenging."
