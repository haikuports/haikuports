SUMMARY="Emulation of the game Chip's Challenge"
DESCRIPTION="Tile World is an emulation of the game Chip's Challenge. \
Chip's Challenge was originally written for the Atari Lynx by Chuck Sommerville, \
and was later ported to MS Windows by Microsoft (among other ports). \
Chip's Challenge is a game made up of both intellectually engaging puzzles \
and situations demanding fast reflexes. As you might have guessed, \
it is a tile-based game. The object of each level is simply to get out â€” i.e., \
to find and achieve the exit tile. This simple task, however, \
can sometimes be extremely challenging."
