SUMMARY="An Atomix clone with a slight change in concept"
DESCRIPTION="LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. \
Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. \
Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to move \
it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it more \
interesting there are obstacles like one-way streets, crumbling walls and \
portals. As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit \
and not a time limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think."
