SUMMARY="Generate documentation from source code"
DESCRIPTION="Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating \
documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular \
programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL \
(Corba  and Microsoft flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.
Doxygen can:
  * generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an \
off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source \
files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), \
PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The \
documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much \
easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
 * extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is \
very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. \
Doxygen can also visualize the relations between the various elements \
by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and \
collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically."
