I give permission for anyone to freely distribute the SOFTWARE so long
as all files are distributed with it. In no way should any part of
GALer (software or hardware) be sold for profit.

GALer is SHAREWARE. If you want to get the circuit diagram for the GAL
device programmer please send 20 DM or 15 US $ to my address. If you want
to send me a foreign cheque please add 10 US $ for cashing.

If you send me a disk you will be sent the next update of GALer when it
becomes available.

The circiut diagram of the GAL device programmer is NOT freely
distributable. It is also not allowed to sell the GAL device programmer
for profit.
