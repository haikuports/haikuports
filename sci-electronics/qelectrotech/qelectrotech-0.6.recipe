SUMMARY="Create electric diagrams"
DESCRIPTION="QElectroTech is an application to create primarily, electrical, \
electronics, automation and control circuits. However, QElectroTech can be \
exploited to create mechanical objects to illustrate processes, \
instrumentation drawings among various creative possibilities. QElectroTech \
is a good professional quality drafting application for various drawings that \
form a project.

QElectroTech has a large collection of standard and custom symbols, referred \
to as elements, that describe most of the commonly used components in \
electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, computer systems. These elements can be \
selected drag dropped with mouse on to a diagram editor and connected with \
lines to represent or describe a system. A large number of such diagrams can \
be drafted under a project.

QElectroTech also consists of an inbuilt element editor that permits creation \
of newer elements that do not exist in the collection. Elements in the QET \
collection are not editable i.e read only. But, once the element is drag \
dropped into a diagram, it is automatically added to “imported” collection in \
a duplicate copy. This copy of the element will be available for editing to \
effect suitable changes to create customized symbols."
