SUMMARY="Tool to show (La)TeX dvi files as text"
DESCRIPTION="dvitty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only devices (terminals and \
lineprinters). The output is not very pretty many times, but it still saves quite a lot of work, \
especially if you have a little ways to walk to a laserprinter, for example.

The program was originally written in Hedrick-Pascal, running on TOPS-20, and was later ported to \
UNIX (BSD, Berkeley-pascal).

It is not very smart in all situations, but still serves it pur- pose fairly well.

For information on how to use see the man-page.

Disdvi is a simple hack that dumps a dvi file in a more readable form.  It is not a spectacular \
program but use it and improve as you wish. I'd appreciate any enhancements made, bug reports \
etc. mailed to me."
