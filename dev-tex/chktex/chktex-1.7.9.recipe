SUMMARY="LaTeX semantic checker"
DESCRIPTION="ChkTeX is a tool to check for common errors in LaTeX files. It also supports \
checking CWEB files (uses a perl5 script). It is highly customizable allowing you turn off any \
warnings you don't like, as well as add your own warnings. It works easily with Emacs and AUCTeX, \
but should also be easy to interface with other editors. If you have interfaced ChkTeX with \
another editor, please contribute how you did it.

It is important to remember that ChkTeX is only intended as a guide to fixing faults. It is by no \
means always correct. This means that correct LaTeX code may produce errors in ChkTeX, and vice \
versa: incorrect LaTeX code may pass silently through. If you have ideas for new warnings or ways \
in which current warnings could be improved, please report them on the bug tracker."
