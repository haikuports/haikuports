SUMMARY="Boot loader for embedded boards"
DESCRIPTION="boot loader for embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and several other \
processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to \
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application code.

The development of U-Boot is closely related to Linux: some parts of \
the source code originate in the Linux source tree, we have some \
header files in common, and special provision has been made to \
support booting of Linux images.

Some attention has been paid to make this software easily \
configurable and extendable. For instance, all monitor commands are \
implemented with the same call interface, so that it's very easy to \
add new commands. Also, instead of permanently adding rarely used \
code (for instance hardware test utilities) to the monitor, you can \
load and run it dynamically."
