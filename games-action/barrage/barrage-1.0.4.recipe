SUMMARY="A destructive shooting game"
DESCRIPTION="Barrage is a rather destructive action game that puts you on a \
shooting range with the objective to hit as many dummy targets as possible \
within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may either fire small or large \
grenades at soldiers, jeeps and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require \
careful aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. In addition, \
you have to keep an eye on your ammo and reload in time."
