SUMMARY="Blast the Asteroids!"
DESCRIPTION="
You pilot your ship through the dreaded \"Maelstrom\" asteroid belt -- suddenly
your best friend thrusts towards you and fires, directly at your cockpit. You
raise your shields just in time, and the battle is joined.

The deadliest stretch of space known to mankind has just gotten deadlier.
Everywhere massive asteroids jostle for a chance to crush your ship, and deadly
shinobi fighter patrols pursue you across the asteroid belt. But the deadliest
of them all is your sister ship, assigned to you on patrol. The pilot, trained
by your own Navy, battle hardened by months in the Maelstrom, is equipped with
a twin of your own ship and intimate knowledge of your tactics.

The lovely Stratocaster R&R facility never sounded so good, but as you fire
full thrusters to dodge the latest barrage you begin to think you'll never get
home..."
