SUMMARY="Fast-paced 3D lightcycle game based on Tron"
DESCRIPTION="Armagetron is a multiplayer game in 3d that attempts to emulate \
and expand on the lightcycle sequence from the movie Tron. It's an old school \
arcade game slung into the 21st century. Highlights include a customizable \
playing arena, HUD, unique graphics, and AI bots. For the more advanced player \
there are new game modes and a wide variety of physics 	settings to tweak as \
well."
