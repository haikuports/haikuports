Syndicate Wars Port is a port of the 1996 DOS game

Syndicate Wars to modern operating systems. In particular, it runs on GNU,
Mac OS and Windows, but it should also work on any system supported by the
SDL library on the i386 architecture.

To create the port, we disassembled the original DOS executable and replaced
most of the DOS-specific parts with platform-independent code, using SDL for
input and video display, Vorbis for music and OpenAL for sound.

As part of the port we only provide a modernised executable which will run on
contemporary systems. However, we do not provide the game data. To install
the Syndicate Wars Port, you will need to have the original data from the
Syndicate Wars CD.

The port is not fully complete. It is possible to finish the single player
campaigns, but support for networking is missing. There is also no support for
joystick control.

Installing

Insert the Syndicate Wars CD and make sure it is mounted
(e.g. in /media/cdrom)
Do "swarsinstall -f SOURCE -t TARGET -l LANG -M", or
"swarsinstall-x86 -f SOURCE -t TARGET -l LANG -M", 
where SOURCE is the game CD path, like /media/cdrom,
TARGET is the destination path, either /system/settings/swars or
~/config/settings/swars (depending on where you installed the package),
LANG is the installation language, and can be one of: eng fre ita spa swe.

Note that on haiku the installer can't currently rip the music, but you can
manually rip it to ogg format and place track_1.ogg, track_2.ogg and
track_3.ogg into /system/settings/swars/music or
~/config/settings/swars/music

Run swars, or swars-x86, to play!
