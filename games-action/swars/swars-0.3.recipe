SUMMARY="Port of the DOS game Syndicate Wars"
DESCRIPTION="Syndicate Wars presents a followup to the events in Syndicate \
taking place 95 years later (the year 2191). At the game's opening, the \
player-controlled syndicate (called EuroCorp) is at the peak of its power \
(achieved in the previous game), an alliance of corporations controlling the \
world through a combination of military and economic power, and \
technological mind control. Corporate decisions are facilitated through a \
number of AI entities connected through a global communications network.

Syndicate Wars preserves the isometric view of Syndicate, while adding \
rotation and pitch controls over the view. Control over agents \
(or acolytes, when playing as the Church) is largely the same as the \
previous syndicate games, being based on a combination of keyboard and \
mouse actions.
