SUMMARY="A 2D space trading and combat game"
DESCRIPTION="Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game \
similar to the classic Escape Velocity series. Explore other star systems. \
Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. \
Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines \
on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. \
Or leave human space behind and hope to find friendly aliens whose culture \
is more civilized than your own."
