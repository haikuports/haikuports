SUMMARY="Offline conference schedules viewer"
DESCRIPTION="ConfClerk is an application written in ​Qt, which makes \
conference schedules available offline. \
It displays the conference schedule from various views, supports \
searches on various items (speaker, speech topic, location, etc.) \
and enables you to select favorite events and create your own schedule.

At the moment ConfClerk is able to import schedules in XML format \
created by the ​PentaBarf conference management system (or ​frab) \
used by ​FOSDEM, ​DebConf, ​Grazer Linuxtage, the ​CCC congresses, \
​FrOSCon, and others."
