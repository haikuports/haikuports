SUMMARY="A nonlinear presentation software"
DESCRIPTION="Multitalk is an SDL based presentation program with slides laid \
on a grid instead of linearly. Slides can have any size (bigger or smaller \
than the screen, and you can move in both directions between them. Hyperlinks \
are also possible.

A PDF on how to use Multitalk and examples are found in \
/system/documentation/packages/multitalk."
