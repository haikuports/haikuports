SUMMARY="A nonlinear presentation software"
DESCRIPTION="MultiTalk is an SDL based presentation program with slides laid \
on a grid instead of linearly. Slides can have any size (bigger or smaller \
than the screen, and you can move in both directions between them. Hyperlinks \
are also possible."
