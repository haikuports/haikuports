SUMMARY="A document processor based on structure rather than appearance"
DESCRIPTION="LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease \
of use of a graphical interface. This results in world-class support for creation \
of mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured \
documents like academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of \
scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come standard. But \
you can also use LyX to create a letter or a novel or a theatre play or film \
script. A broad array of ready, well-designed document layouts are built in.

LyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of the box. \
No more endless tinkering with formatting details, \"finger painting\" font \
attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just write. On screen, \
LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output - or richly \
cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced - looks like nothing else."
