SUMMARY="Tab-completion for the Bash shell"
DESCRIPTION="Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program \
and extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command \
lines with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being \
able to complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing \
man 3 str [Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in \
the UNIX manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported \
file-systems from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete \
on all targets in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce \
programmable completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, \
reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on \
a daily basis."
