SUMMARY="Context-aware bash history search replacement (ctrl-r)"
DESCRIPTION="McFly replaces your default ctrl-r shell history search with an intelligent search \
engine that takes into account your working directory and the context of recently executed \
commands. McFly's suggestions are prioritized in real time with a small neural network.

TL;DR: an upgraded ctrl-r where history results make sense for what you're working on right now.

Features:
* Rebinds ctrl-r to bring up a full-screen reverse history search prioritized with a small neural \
network.
* Augments your shell history to track command exit status, timestamp, and execution directory in \
a SQLite database.
* Maintains your normal shell history file as well so that you can stop using McFly whenever you \
want.
* Unicode support throughout.
* Includes a simple action to scrub any history item from the McFly database and your shell \
history files.
* Designed to be extensible for other shells in the future.
* Written in Rust, so it's fast and safe.
* You can type % to match any number of characters when searching.
* Supports Zsh, Bash (version 3+), and PowerShell (version 7+)

To enable McFly on:
* bash: add 'eval \"\$(mcfly init bash)\"' to the end of ~/config/settings/profile
* zsh: add 'eval \"\$(mcfly init zsh)\"' to the end of ~/config/settings/zsh/zshrc

And then restart Terminal."
