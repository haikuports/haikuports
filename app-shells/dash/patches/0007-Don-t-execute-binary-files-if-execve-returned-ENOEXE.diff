Subject: Don't execute binary files if execve() returned ENOEXEC

Both "dash -c foo" and "./foo" are supposed to be able to run hashbang-less
scripts, but attempts to execute common binary files tend to be nasty:
especially both ELF and PE tend to make dash create a bunch of files with
unprintable names, that in turn confuse some tools up to causing data loss.

Thus, let's read the first line and see if it looks like text.  This is a
variant of the approach used by bash and zsh; mksh instead checks for
signatures of a bunch of common file types.

POSIX says: "If the executable file is not a text file, the shell may bypass
this command execution.".
