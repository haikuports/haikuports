SUMMARY="A cross-platform open source BitTorrent client"
DESCRIPTION="Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike \
some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to \
make money:
- Transmission doesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, \
or anything else.
- It doesn't hold some feaures back for a payware version.
- Its source code is available for anyone to review.
- They don't track our users, and their website and forums have no third-party \
ads or analytics.

Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. They've set the defaults to \
Just Work and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like \
watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface.
In separate benchmarks, Linux Format and Lacrocivious both found Transmission \
to use less CPU than any other GUI client. It even used less CPU than some \
non-GUI clients.
Transmission also has the lowest memory footprint of any major BitTorrent \
client.

Imageshack chose Transmission for its BitTorrent farms because the competition \
requires amounts of memory several times greater than Transmission.
Transmission's small footprint is one reason why many home device \
manufacturers, such as FON, Belkin, and Networked Media Tank ship with \
Transmission. When Belkin and Vuze Inc. partnered to write a Torrent Genie to \
let people who ran Vuze and owned a Belkin router keep sharing files even when \
Vuze wasn't running, they decided to use Transmission -- not Vuze's own BitTorrent client -- on the router.
Unlike many cross-platform applications, Transmission integrates seamlessly \
with your operating system.

Transmission has the features you want from a BitTorrent client: encryption, a \
web interface, peer exchange, magnet links, DHT, ÂµTP, UPnP and NAT-PMP port \
forwarding, webseed support, watch directories, tracker editing, global and \
per-torrent speed limits, and more."
