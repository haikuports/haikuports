SUMMARY="dillon's lightweight cron daemon"
DESCRIPTION="
This is a continuation of Matt Dillon's beautifully minimalist dcron. At first
I had written a fork (yacron), but Matt has handed over maintainership of the
main dcron branch, so all of yacron was merged into dcron 4.0.

The biggest changes in v4.0 are syslogging and a variety of anacron-like
features. If you use this version of dcron, you shouldn't have any further need
for anacron.

More specifically, dcron can now:
* log to syslog or a file
* email job output to a remote addresses, instead of the local user who owns \
	the job (so it works with lightweight mail handlers like msmtp, which \
	don't route mail to local users).
* replace sendmail with any other script to which all job output should be piped
* various crontab syntax extensions, including @daily and @reboot and more \
	finer-grained frequency specifiers. See manpages for details.
