SUMMARY="Measure CPU and memory resources"
DESCRIPTION="Time is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as time and \
memory, that other programs use. The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by \
using a printf-style format string to include various resource measurements. Some systems do not \
provide much information about program resource use; time reports unavailable information as \
zero values."
