SUMMARY="A replayer program for C64 music (SID tunes) for Haiku and Unix"
DESCRIPTION="SIDPlayer is a replayer program for C64 music (SID tunes) for BeOS \
and Unix. You can think of it as being a stripped-down C64 emulator that only \
emulates the processor and the sound chip of the C64. \
SIDPlayer can be used as a stand-alone player or, under Haiku, as a plug-in \
for CL-Amp and SoundPlay."
