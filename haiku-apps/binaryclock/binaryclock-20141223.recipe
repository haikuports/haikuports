SUMMARY="A binary clock application and screensaver"
DESCRIPTION="A Binary Clock. And yes, you really can use this to tell time! I \
have found it quite enjoyable to reprogram my brain to learn to read it at a \
glance. It just takes a little getting used to.

How to read the Binary Clock:

Each column stands for a digit in a 24 hour clock with the format: hh : mm : ss
Each column is configured like this:
 8
 4
 2
 1

so if you wanted "2", you would see: (O being off, X being on)
 O
 O
 X
 O

5 would be:
 O
 X
 O
 X

so 8:57:12pm would be 20:57:12 which would look like:
 OO	 OO	 OO
 OO	 XX	 OO
 XO	 OX	 OX
 OO	 XX	 XO

Good Luck!"
