SUMMARY="Simple, powerful contact manager for Haiku"
DESCRIPTION="Mr. Peeps! is an app for managing People files that has more \
features than other contact managers. Highlights:
 * Autosave: no more clicking File|Save or typing Alt-S. Edit it and it's \
saved that way.
 * Fast keyboard navigation:
   * Use Tab and Shift-Tab to jump between data fields
   * Alt-Up and Alt-Down go to the next/previous person, no matter what
   * When using the People list, use the cursor keys or jump to a person \
using a letter key
   * Use the Alt key plus the 1-5 keys to change tabs, i.e. Alt+2 is the \
Personal tab
 * Multiple groups - separate group names with a comma
 * Native Language support - Mr. Peeps! can now show itself in your own \
language and you can change languages quickly, if you so choose.
 * More Data: handles more types of data than even People v2 and \
DeeperPeople, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and other personal data."
