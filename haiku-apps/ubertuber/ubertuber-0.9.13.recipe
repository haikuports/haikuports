SUMMARY="A tool to play back online videos in MediaPlayer"
DESCRIPTION="UberTuber grabs clips from various sites and opens them in your \
media player while they're being downloaded. The Python script youtube-dl \
downloads the video file to the temporary folder. From there it is either \
played back while it gets downloaded or moved to another location determined \
in a file dialog.

UberTuber monitors the system clipboard for URLs pointing to the supported \
websites and automatically inserts them into its URL text field.

If the playback of a clip from a particular website works, depends on the \
underlying youtube-dl script, which gets updated from time to time. At this \
moment there is support for clips from:

YouTube, Google video, MetaCafe, DailyMotion, Yahoo video, Photobucket, \
DepositFiles, Vimeo.com, blip.tv, Facebook video, Escapist magazine and many \
more
