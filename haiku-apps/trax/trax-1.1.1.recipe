SUMMARY="Find files by name AND location, unlike Haiku's Find"
DESCRIPTION="TraX is not a \"query\" tool. It does not keep a database of files and attributes. \
It is a traditional find tool, which searches the disk every time, looking for files that meet \
your criteria. The find-criteria are not Haiku specific, and it does not (currently) search \
attributes.

TraX comes in two varieties.

 * FastTraX is similar to the Windows find tool. Windows users should find its features very \
familiar.
 * TraX is a cross between the UNIX \"find\" command the the MacOS \"Find Files\" tool. It has \
much of the power of \"find\" with a Mac-like interface (a Mac on steroids that is)."
