SUMMARY="A native file sharing and chat application"
DESCRIPTION="BeShare is a BeOS/Haiku-native file sharing program. \
It operates similarly to other such programs (Napster, Hotline, etc) \
but with a few advantages:

- BeShare allows you to upload or download any type of file, not just mp3.
- When browsing files, you can see their attributes (similar Tracker's \
view)
- Your query is always \"live\", so if new files that match your query become \
available, you will see them added to the results list right away (you won't \
have to click \"refresh\" or anything first)
- BeShare includes a rudimentary chat mechanism for you social types.
- BeShare supports any number of simultaneous uploads and downloads \
in parallel, but will serialize simultaneous file requests to any \
given host for efficiency."
