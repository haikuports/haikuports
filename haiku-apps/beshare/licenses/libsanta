The source code, object code, libraries, and the other components of Santa's Gift Bag are being made publicly available and free to use in freeware and shareware products with a price under $25 (I believe that shareware should be cheap). For overpriced shareware (hehehe) or commercial products, please contact me to negotiate a fee for use. After all, I did work hard on these classes and invested a lot of time into it. That being said, DON'T WORRY I don't want much. It totally depends on the sort of project you're working on and how much you expect to make off it. If someone makes money using my work, I'd like to get at least a little something for my contribution to that profit.

If any of the components of Santa's Gift Bag are is used in a shareware or commercial product, I get a free copy.  The source is made available so that you can improve and extend it as you need. In general it is best to customize these classes through inheritance, leaving the original Santa's Gift Bag source code unmodified, so that you can take advantage of enhancements and bug fixes as they become available. 

Feel free to distribute any components of this archive, but you are required to keep the documentation and license with it.  If you wish to distribute modified source, also feel free to do so, but do so in such a manner that it is very clear what was modified, why, how, that it is not an official Santa's Gift Bag release, and you are also required to keep the documentation and license with any modified versions.

Thank you for using Santa's Gift Bag, and enjoy!
