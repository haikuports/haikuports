SUMMARY="Beshare" 
DESCRIPTION="BeShare is a BeOS/Haiku-native file sharing program. \
	It operates similarly to other such programs (Napster, Hotline, etc) \
	but with a few advantages:

    - BeShare allows you to upload or download any type \
    of file, not just mp3.
    - When browsing files, you can see their attributes \
    (similar to Be's Tracker view)
    - Your query is always \"live\", so if new files that \
    match your query become available, you will see them \
    added to the results list right away (you won't have to \
    click "refresh" or anything first)
    - BeShare includes a rudimentary chat mechanism for you social types.
    - BeShare supports any number of simultaneous uploads and downloads \
    in parallel, but will serialize simultaneous file requests to any \
    given host for efficiency.
