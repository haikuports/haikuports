SUMMARY="A program to rip CDs into digital music files"
DESCRIPTION="MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. Designed with ease-of-use as being priority one, \
it is simple, effective, and lets you get on to bigger and better things, like \
listening to your to music. SimplyVorbis is not for the audiophile and probably \
not for the hardcore geek; it is for the rest of us, people who don't want to be \
hassled with technical details, who just want to turn CDs into music files to \
listen to while we work at the keyboard or take with us on an iPod and want to have \
all the BeOS goodness of attributes without having to resort to something like \
ArmyKnife (which does have its uses). Pop in a CD, select the songs you want, and \
hit 'Go'. Period. It can even make playlists for you if you like. Your music isn't \
limited by copy protection (DRM) either, so you can have all the flexibility of Fair Use."
