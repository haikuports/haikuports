SUMMARY="Real-time interactive fractal zoomer"
DESCRIPTION="
XaoS is an interactive fractal zoomer. It allows the user to continuously \
zoom in or out of a fractal in a fluid, continuous motion. This capability \
makes XaoS great for exploring fractals, and it’s fun!

If you don’t know what fractals are, don’t worry. \
XaoS includes many animated tutorials that make learning about fractals fun \
and easy. These tutorials are also a great introduction to all of XaoS’s \
features.

XaoS can display many different fractal types, including Mandelbrot, \
Barnsley, Newton, Phoenix, and many more. Fractals can be rendered using \
various coloring methods and planes for an almost endless variety of images. \
XaoS also supports switching between Julia and Mandelbrot sets for each formula.

XaoS currently runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other Unix-like systems. \
Older versions are available for DOS, BeoS, and more. Download a copy for your \
operating system today.

XaoS is free software, licensed under the GPL. It was originally written by \
Thomas Marsh and Jan Hubicka, and it is currently maintained by Zoltan Kovacs \
and J.B. Langston. Countless other improvements have been contributed by \
volunteers around the world. You can help improve XaoS, too."
