+## BeOS Generic Makefile v2.5 ##
+
+## Fill in this file to specify the project being created, and the referenced
+## makefile-engine will do all of the hard work for you.  This handles both
+## Intel and PowerPC builds of the BeOS and Haiku.
+
+## Application Specific Settings ---------------------------------------------
+
+# specify the name of the binary
+NAME= Colors
+
+# specify the type of binary
+#	APP:	Application
+#	SHARED:	Shared library or add-on
+#	STATIC:	Static library archive
+#	DRIVER: Kernel Driver
+TYPE= APP
+
+# 	if you plan to use localization features 
+# 	specify the application MIME siganture
+APP_MIME_SIG= application/x-vnd.Haiku-Colors!
+
+#	add support for new Pe and Eddie features
+#	to fill in generic makefile
+
+#%{

+#	specify the source files to use
+#	full paths or paths relative to the makefile can be included
+# 	all files, regardless of directory, will have their object
+#	files created in the common object directory.
+#	Note that this means this makefile will not work correctly
+#	if two source files with the same name (source.c or source.cpp)
+#	are included from different directories.  Also note that spaces
+#	in folder names do not work well with this makefile.

+#	-	if your library follows the naming pattern of:
+#		libXXX.so or libXXX.a you can simply specify XXX
+#		library: libbe.so entry: be
+#
+#	-	for version-independent linking of standard C++ libraries please add
+#		$(STDCPPLIBS) instead of raw "stdc++[.r4] [supc++]" library names
+#
+#	-	for localization support add following libs:
+#		locale localestub
+#		
+#	- 	if your library does not follow the standard library
+#		naming scheme you need to specify the path to the library
+#		and it's name
+#		library: my_lib.a entry: my_lib.a or path/my_lib.a
+LIBS= be $(STDCPPLIBS) textencoding tracker

+#	specify additional paths to directories following the standard
+#	libXXX.so or libXXX.a naming scheme.  You can specify full paths
+#	or paths relative to the makefile.  The paths included may not

+# 	languages catkeys. All localization files must be placed
+# 	in "locales" sub-directory.

+#	specify any preprocessor symbols to be defined.  The symbols will not
+#	have their values set automatically; you must supply the value (if any)
+#	to use.  For example, setting DEFINES to "DEBUG=1" will cause the
