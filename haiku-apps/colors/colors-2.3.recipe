SUMMARY="A color picker like that in Adobe Photoshop"
DESCRIPTION="
	You can easily choose a color and then drag it to the place where you \
	need it: for example the Haiku Desktop, Insite Constructor, any text \
	editor (insert as HTML hex code) and much more...
The Features:

 * You can collect up to 10 favorite colors which are restored the next time \
 you start Colors.
 * You get a color preview for text (text and background color).
 * With an eye-dropper tool you can pick a color from anywhere on your desktop.
