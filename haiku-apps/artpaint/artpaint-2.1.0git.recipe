SUMMARY="An award winning painting and image-processing program"
DESCRIPTION="The main features of ArtPaint include a comprehensive set of \
painting-tools and real-time preview for many image-manipulating operations. \
The key design principle has been to let the user see what they are doing \
instead of just forcing them to type in some numbers and then hoping that \
the result will not be too far from the expected."
