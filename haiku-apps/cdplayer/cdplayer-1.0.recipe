SUMMARY="A 'remote control' for the CD-ROM drive"
DESCRIPTION="
CDPlayer is like a remote control for the CD-ROM drive. It completely \
by-passes Haiku's media services. If your CD-ROM drive doesn't support \
that or its audio outputs aren't connected to speakers (or routed through \
your soundcard), you won't hear a thing...
Modern computers only rarely fulfill these requirements.

In that case you're better off mounting the CD in Tracker and use \
MediaPlayer to play back the audio files in its wav folder."
