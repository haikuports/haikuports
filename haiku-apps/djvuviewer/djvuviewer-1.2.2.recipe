SUMMARY="A viewer for DjVu files"
DESCRIPTION="
This app is a viewer for DjVu files. DjVu is a computer file format designed \
primarily to store scanned documents, especially those containing a \
combination of text, line drawings, indexed color images, and photographs. \
It uses technologies such as image layer separation of text and \
background/images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding, and lossy \
compression for bitonal (monochrome) images. This allows for high-quality, \
readable images to be stored in a minimum of space, so that they can be made \
available on the web.

Main features:
* Multilingual user interface
* Themes
* Ability to save selected page in any available format through the use of \
Translators
* Fullscreen mode
* PgUp/PgDown navigation
* Smooth scaling based on Haiku's ShowImage filter
* Ability to go to specific page number"
