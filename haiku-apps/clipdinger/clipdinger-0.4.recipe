SUMMARY="A tool to manage a history of the system clipboard"
DESCRIPTION="Clipdinger solves the problem that you often have to paste some \
text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but which has been \
replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the \
history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.

Clipdinger provides a history of your recent clippings and lets you create \
your own favorites. It should be started automatically on every boot-up by \
creating a link to it at ~/config/settings/boot/launch/.

You access the history by pressing SHIFT + ALT + V, which opens the \
Clipdinger window where you can select an entry with the cursor keys and \
paste it by hitting RETURN. ESCAPE minimizes the window without pasting.

Please see the ReadMe available from the Help menu for more details."
