SUMMARY="A tool to manage a history of the system clipboard"
DESCRIPTION="Clipdinger solves the problem that you often have to paste some \
text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but which has been \
replaced by something you've copied more recentlyâ€¦ It also saves the \
history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.

Clipdinger provides a history of your recent clippings, lets you filter it \
and create your own favorites. It also offers a clipboard monitor that can \
be used as a replicant on the Desktop, always showing the current contents.

You access the history by pressing SHIFT + ALT + V, which opens the \
Clipdinger window where you can select an entry with the cursor keys and \
paste it by hitting RETURN.

After selecting a clip, you can also paste it to the an online service by \
hitting ALT + P. The returned URL for the clip is put into the \
clipboard for you to paste into your email or IRC channel etc.

ESCAPE minimizes the window without pasting.

Please see the ReadMe available from the Help menu for more details."
