SUMMARY="A tool to manage a history of the system clipboard"
DESCRIPTION="Clipdinger solves the problem that you often have to paste some \
text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but which has been \
replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the \
history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.

Clipdinger provides a history of your recent clippings and should be started \
automatically on every boot-up by creating a link to it at ~/config/settings/\
boot/launch/.

You access the history by pressing SHIFT + ALT + V, which opens the \
Clipdinger window where you can select an entry with the cursor keys and \
paste it by hitting RETURN. ESCAPE minimizes the window without pasting."
