SUMMARY="A powerful renaming utility"
DESCRIPTION="
PecoRename is a powerful renaming utility, which allows you to rename many \
files according to a preset pattern. It also installs a Tracker add-on that \
can be invoked on the selected files with the shortcut ALT+OPT+R.

You can rename your files in many different ways:
 * Number your files in order
 * Search and replace
 * Delete characters
 * Make uppercase/lowercase
 * Add the suitable file extension according to the file type
 * Insert, append or replace text...

PecoRename gives you an easy to use interface with a powerful tool behind it.\
The changes can be previewed in realtime.
And - of course - all functions support special chars (like ä, â...).

Whenever you have to rename some or many files the same way, this is YOUR \
program!"
