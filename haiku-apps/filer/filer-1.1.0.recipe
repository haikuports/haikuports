SUMMARY="An automated file management and sorting system"
DESCRIPTION="The Filer is a powerful, flexible automatic file organizer. It \
is an implementation of the 'Sorting Chute' idea conceived on the Glass \
Elevator mailing list for Haiku.

Filer takes the files it's opened with or that are dropped onto it's icon or \
replicatable dropzone and moves, renames, copies or does all sorts of other \
things with them according to rules created by the user.

Filer is accompanied by AutoFiler. Instead of working on a set of files \
provided by the user, it can be started together with Haiku to monitor certain \
folders and deal with new files appearing there according to the user-defined \
rules.

If you've used an earlier version of Filer (pre v1.1.0), you'll have to remove \
and re-create your rules."
