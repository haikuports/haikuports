SUMMARY="An automated file management system to copy, rename, move and modify files in an automated fashion"

DESCRIPTION="
	The Filer is a powerful, flexible automatic file organizer. It is an implementation of the
	Sorting Chute idea conceived on the Glass Elevator mailing list for Haiku.
	Just drag and drop files onto its icon, use the Terminal, or send it files via the Open With menu.
	It can even automatically file items in folders you specify. Simple enough for the novice user,
	powerful enough for developers. It automates file management according to a set of rules you determine
	and is pretty much limited only by your imagination. Powerful on its own, it can also be extended by shell scripting.
