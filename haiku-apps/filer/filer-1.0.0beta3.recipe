SUMMARY="An automated file management system"
DESCRIPTION="
The Filer is a powerful, flexible automatic file organizer. It is an \
implementation of the Sorting Chute idea conceived on the Glass Elevator \
mailing list for Haiku. Just drag and drop files onto its icon, use the \
Terminal, or send it files via the Open With menu. It can even automatically \
file items in folders you specify. Simple enough for the novice user, powerful \
enough for developers. It automates file management according to a set of \
rules you determine and is pretty much limited only by your imagination. \
Powerful on its own, it can also be extended by shell scripting.
