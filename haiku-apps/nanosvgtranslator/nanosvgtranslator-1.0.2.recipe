SUMMARY="A translator for SVG files"
DESCRIPTION="This is a translator for SVG files based on nanosvg headers by \
Mikko Mononen (https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg). Scalable Vector \
Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional \
graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is \
an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since \
1999.

SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means \
that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. As XML files, \
SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, but are more \
often created with drawing software."
