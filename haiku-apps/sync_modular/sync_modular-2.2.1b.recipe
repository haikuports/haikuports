SUMMARY="Native, modular software synthesizer"
DESCRIPTION="Sync Modular is a modular synthesizer allowing you to build your \
own synthesizer and sounds. In 2010, Sync modular became a freeware. You can \
use this name and serial number to register the application:

User name : Free registration
Serial number : eCDiPa-kbbmPZ-zGDJuyU

You can download instruments and macros created by users from SyncModular's \
website.

These are the most important features of SynC Modular:

* SynC Modular is modular. This means that it has no fixed structure. Instead \
it allows you to create your own synth structures, as well as using the synth \
structures created by others. Ideally you can simulate any synthesizer with \
its modular features. In practice, though, there are always limits to all \
vanilla promises.

* SynC Modular is multitimbral. You can have as many as 16 different synths \
playing at the same time within SynC Modular. Besides that you can change any \
of those synths for another one on the fly, by means of MIDI program change. \
The limit to this vanilla promise is your CPU performance which sets the top \
margin on the overall complexity of the synths.

* SynC Modular is fast. With its unique modular optimization technology it \
offers you the performance of a non-modular software synth.

* SynC Modular is flexible. It allows you to go down the module structure as \
deep as creating your own oscillators and filters! The Sawtooth oscillator, \
the Sine oscillator, the 1- and 2-pole filters and many more modules are not \
the basic pieces. You can dig further into their internal structure. This is \
only limited by your knowledge of DSP theory if you are willing to design \
your own filters, rather than combining the existing ones. You can always use \
filters created by someone else, of course"
