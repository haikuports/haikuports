SUMMARY="An image viewer/organiser designed for BeOS-compatible systems"
DESCRIPTION="Album is a file browsing and tagging utility for BeOS/Haiku. \
The idea is to have a work pad for pictures from different locations so they \
may be viewed and tagged. \
The program is not limited to pictures and BFS (Be File System) volumes, \
although that makes most sense since some of the functionality has to do with \
file attributes."
