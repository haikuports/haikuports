SUMMARY="An image viewer/organiser designed for BeOS-compatible systems."
DESCRIPTION="Album is a file browsing and tagging utility for Haiku. It \
started out with a goal of the ultimate image organiser (code named \
Aberration), but ended up as something much more modest and BeOS-specific. The \
idea is to have a work pad for pictures from different locations where they \
can be previewed and tagged in one place. The program is not limited to \
picture files and BFS volumes, although this further limits usefulness \
since much of the functionality has to do with file attributes."
