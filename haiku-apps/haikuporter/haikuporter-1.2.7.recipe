SUMMARY="Build packages for the Haiku operating system"
DESCRIPTION="The HaikuPorter tool is provided to ease the fetching, patching \
and building of source code. It can be compared to a slim version of Gentoo \
Portage. Each port contains the Haiku-specific patches to the original source \
code. It fetches the original source code, applies the Haiku-specific \
patches, builds the software, and packages it according to so-called 'recipes'.

See the wiki on the HaikuPorter website for more information on its usage \
and details on how to create those recipes."
