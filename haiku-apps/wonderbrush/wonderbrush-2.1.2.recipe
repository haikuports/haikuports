SUMMARY="Native editor for bitmap graphics"
DESCRIPTION="WonderBrush is an editor for bitmap graphics. The main window holds any number of documents, which are called Canvas. A canvas has an associated name and pixel resolution as well as some other properties. It also references up to two files, which represent it on disk, one is a file in some export format (ie. an SVG document, a flat Translator bitmap or soure code), the other a full-featured project file.
Each canvas can have any number of Layers, currently arranged as a list. Each layer represents an individual bitmap in the size of the canvas. Depending on each layers blending mode, they are composed on top of each other to form the final canvas bitmap.
Each layer can contain any number of Objects, which are created by WonderBrushs tools. Each object has a set of properties which define the unique appearance of the object on the layer.
At any time, it is possible to reorder the layers, or the objects they contain. This could be called non-linear editing. It is also possible to change most of an objects properties later on. This could be called non-destructive editing, because adding another object (like a filter) does not actually destroy any pixel data."
