SUMMARY="Native editor for bitmap graphics"
DESCRIPTION="
WonderBrush is an editor for bitmap graphics. The main window holds any number \
of documents, which are called Canvas. A canvas has an associated name and \
pixel resolution as well as some other properties. It also references up to \
two files, which represent it on disk, one is a file in some export format \
(ie. an SVG document, a flat Translator bitmap or soure code), the other a \
full-featured project file.
Each canvas can have any number of Layers, currently arranged as a list. Each \
layer represents an individual bitmap in the size of the canvas. Depending on \
each layers blending mode, they are composed on top of each other to form the \
final canvas bitmap.
Each layer can contain any number of Objects, which are created by \
WonderBrush's tools. Each object has a set of properties which define the \
unique appearance of the object on the layer.
At any time, it is possible to reorder the layers, or the objects they \
contain. This could be called non-linear editing. It is also possible to \
change most of an objects properties later on. This could be called \
non-destructive editing, because adding another object (like a filter) does \
not actually destroy any pixel data.
