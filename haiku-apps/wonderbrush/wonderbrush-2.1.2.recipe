SUMMARY="A native editor for vector/bitmap graphics"
DESCRIPTION="WonderBrush is an editor for bitmap and vector graphics.

The main window holds any number of documents, which are called Canvas. Each \
canvas can have any number of Layers, arranged as a list. Each layer \
represents an individual bitmap in the size of the canvas. Depending on each \
layer's blending mode, they are composed on top of each other to form the \
final canvas bitmap.

Each layer can contain any number of Objects, which are created with \
WonderBrush's tools, e.g. brush strokes, shapes, text objects or filters. Each \
object has a set of properties which define the unique appearance of the \
object on the layer.
At any time, it is possible to reorder the layers, or edit the objects they \
contain. This could be called non-linear editing. It is also possible to \
change most of an object's properties later on. This could be called \
non-destructive editing, because adding another object (like a filter) does \
not actually destroy any pixel data.

An open WonderBrush document references up to two files: one is a file in some \
export format (e.g. an SVG document, some bitmap format like PNG or JPEG, \
etc.). The other is a full-featured project file.

The canvas resolution can be changed at any time, with all objects being \
resized accordingly. This makes WonderBrush a kind of hybrid of bitmap and \
vector editor."
