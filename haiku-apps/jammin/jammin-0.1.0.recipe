SUMMARY="The Jamfile Administrator"
DESCRIPTION="
The JamMin manages jamfiles, because they are most important to the user, \
as they declare the targets that should be built. Jamfiles are also \
used for organizing targets - each Jamfile is a separate project that can \
be built independently from the other projects."
