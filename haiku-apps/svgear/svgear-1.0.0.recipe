SUMMARY="An advanced SVG viewer and vector graphics tool suite"
DESCRIPTION="SVGear is a feature-rich SVG viewer designed specifically for Haiku. \
It bridges the gap between the web-standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format \
and Haiku's native High Efficiency Vector Icon Format (HVIF).

Whether you are a developer, a designer, or a user who wants to customize their \
system, SVGear provides a seamless workflow for working with vector graphics.

Key Features:
* Advanced Viewing: Inspect SVG files with high-quality rendering, adjustable zoom, \
transparency grids, and various display modes.
* Universal Conversion: Import and export files between SVG, HVIF, and Icon-O-Matic \
(IOM) formats, or render vectors to PNG images.
* Online Resources: Search and download icons from the HVIF-Store directly within \
the application.
* Vectorization: Built-in tracing engine to convert raster images (PNG/JPG) into \
vector paths for easy icon creation.
* Developer Tools: View internal file structure and export graphics as C++ source \
code or RDef resources.
* Native Integration: Drag-and-drop support and direct editing via Icon-O-Matic."
