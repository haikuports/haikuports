SUMMARY="New way to create opendocument compatible books/documents"
DESCRIPTION="
This is an attempt to create a new way to create documents or books. It moves \
away from the WYSIWYG paradigm of microsoft word, openoffice, etc. etc. etc. \
It takes a more keyboard only, thought flowing and typing markup language, \
object oriented approach where a user who has ideas or thoughts can jot these \
down and have them go into a list. to build their document/book, they would \
then order the list of thoughts, images, tables, etc. into the correct order \
and preview/publish their book."
