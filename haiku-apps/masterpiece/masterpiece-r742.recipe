DESCRIPTION="
This is an attempt to create a new way to create documents or books. \
It moves away from the WYSIWYG paradigm of microsoft word, openoffice, etc. etc. etc. \
It takes a more keyboard only, thought flowing and typing markup language, object oriented approach \
where a user who has ideas or thoughts can jot these down and have them go into a list. to build their document/book, \
they would then order the list of thoughts, images, tables, etc. into the correct order and preview/publish their book.
