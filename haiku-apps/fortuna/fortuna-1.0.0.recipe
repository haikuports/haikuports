SUMMARY="A small GUI for showing the well known fortunes"
DESCRIPTION="
Fortuna is a nice-looking graphical program which displays a fortune when you \
open it. Yeah, sure, there is already a fortune program, but it only shows \
from the command line, you'll get a lot of repeats, it's quite a bit of work \
to install more, and you have to muck around with your UserBootScript. Lots of \
messing around. Then again, you can use Fortuna, which has none of this."
