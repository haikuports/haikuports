SUMMARY="Automatic desktop color changer"
DESCRIPTION="
This program was inspired by the 'TaveDesktop' program by the Tave Software \
Group. I think that 'TaveDesktop' was a good idea, but I wanted to be able to \
choose my own colors, since the 'TaveDesktop' colors looks bad on an 8bpp \
display.
This program should be self-explanatory. You'll find a small Popup menu when \
clicking the small screen at the top-right corner of the window.
