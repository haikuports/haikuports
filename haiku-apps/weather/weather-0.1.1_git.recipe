SUMMARY="A simple weather application"
DESCRIPTION="This simple weather app was a project for the Google Code-In \
2014/2015.
After supplying a location it will gather data over the internet to display \
a constantly updated forecast for the next days as icons (sunshine, clouds, \
rain, etc.). As a Replicant, the app can be neatly integrated into the \
Desktop."
