SUMMARY="A translator for PDF files"
DESCRIPTION="
This is a translator for PDF files based on MuPDF library.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to present documents in \
a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating \
systems. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout \
flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information \
needed to display it. In 1991, Adobe Systems co-founder John Warnock outlined \
a system called \"Camelot\" that evolved into PDF."
