SUMMARY="Generate tones and test your discrimination of frequency deltas"
DESCRIPTION="PhantomLimb is a little program to generate tones, and test \
your discrimination of frequency deltas. I wrote it for a friend of mine who \
is suffering from tinnitus ('ringing in the ears') due to an ear infection. \
(the infection destroyed some nerve cells in his inner ear, and the lack of \
signals from the destroyed nerve cells is what causes the ringing--similar to \
the 'phantom limb' sensations experienced by amputees. Hence the name of this \
program) By practicing discriminating between the sound of the tinnitus and \
'nearby' sounds, he hopes to be able to train his brain to discriminate \
between the 'phantom' sound and other, real sounds."
