SUMMARY="A Tracker add-on to upload a file or folder to an online service"
DESCRIPTION="UploadIt is a Tracker Add-On that uploads a single file or folder \
to the online service The Null Pointer at http://0x0.st/. A folder gets \
automatically zipped up before it's uploaded.

The URL for the uploaded file is put into the clipboard after the upload has \
finished, ready to be pasted into an email, a chat window or forum post.

Depending on the file size, uploaded files are retained for 30 days to one \
year. The maximum file size is 512 MiB.
0x0.st is NOT a platform for:
* piracy
* pornography
* extremist material of any kind
* malware / botnet C&C
* anything related to crypto currencies
* backups
* CI build artifacts
* doxxing, database dumps containing personal information
* anything illegal under German law

Uploads found to be in violation of these rules will be removed, and the \
originating IP address blocked from further uploads.

Tip: Install Clipdinger from HaikuDepot. It includes a 'Clipboard Monitor' \
that you can embed as Replicant on the Desktop. When you see the upload URL \
appearing there, you know the file was uploaded successfully and the URL can \
be pasted."
