SUMMARY="A Tracker add-on to upload a file to an online service"
DESCRIPTION="UploadIt is a Tracker Add-On that uploads a single file to the \
online service 'The Null Pointer' at https://0x0.st. The URL for the uploaded \
file is put into the clipboard after the upload has finished, ready to be \
pasted into an email, a chat window or forum post.

According to 'The Null Pointer' website:
* Maximum file size: 512.0 MiB
* Not allowed: application/x-dosexec, child pornography
* File URLs are valid for at least 30 days and up to a year, depending on \
file size.

Tip: Install Clipdinger from HaikuDepot. It includes a 'Clipboard Monitor' \
that you can embed as Replicant on the Desktop. When you see the upload URL \
appearing there, you know the file was uploaded successfully and the URL can \
be pasted."
