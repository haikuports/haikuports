SUMMARY="A Tracker add-on to upload a file to an online service"
DESCRIPTION="UploadIt is a Tracker Add-On that uploads a single file to the \
online service Linx at https://linx.li. The URL for the uploaded file is put \
into the clipboard after the upload has finished, ready to be pasted into an \
email, a chat window or forum post.

Currently the expiration time for the uploaded file is hard-coded to 1 week.

Tip: Install Clipdinger from HaikuDepot. It includes a 'Clipboard Monitor' \
that you can embed as Replicant on the Desktop. When you see the upload URL \
appearing there, you know the file was uploaded successfully and the URL can \
be pasted."
