SUMMARY="A time utility that runs inside the Deskbar"
DESCRIPTION="WebWatch is an unofficial port of Swatch's Internet Time utility \
that runs inside the Deskbar.

Someone at Swatch (you know, the company that makes the watches) came up with \
an idea for a universal time format that eliminates time zones and \
geographical borders. The idea is very simple: time is no longer measured in \
hours, minutes, and seconds, but in \"beats.\" A single day consists of 1000 \
beats, so each beat corresponds to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds.
This \"Internet Time\" is the same all over the world, because it is measured \
relatively to something called the Biel Mean Time (BMT), a new meridian that \
lies in Switzerland. A day in Internet Time begins at midnight BMT, or @000 \
Swatch Beats, 12 noon is equivalent to @500 beats, and so on. So if it's @812 \
at my place, it's also 812 beats at yours and everyone else's."
