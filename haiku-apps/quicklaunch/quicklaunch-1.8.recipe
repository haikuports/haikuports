SUMMARY="A tool to quickly start any installed application"
DESCRIPTION="QuickLaunch is a small launcher tool that helps you to quickly \
start any installed application (as long as it has an app-signature). Simply \
start entering the name of an application and QuickLaunch will find all \
programs matching these initial letters and show them in a list.
You choose an app from that list with the CursorUp/Down keys and launch it \
by hitting RETURN. ESC quits QuickLaunch.

Add applications and any other file as favorites that are displayed when \
launching the app.

It's recommended to set a key combo to start QuickLaunch with Haiku's \
Shortcuts preferences."
