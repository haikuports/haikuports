SUMMARY="A tool to quickly start any installed application"
DESCRIPTION="
QuickLaunch is a small launcher tool that helps you to quickly start any \
installed application (as long as it has an app-signature). Simply start \
to enter the name of an application and QuickLaunch will find all programs \
matching these initial letters and show them in a list.
You choose an app from that list with the CursorUp/Down keys and launch it \
by hitting RETURN. ESC quits QuickLaunch.

It's recommended to set a key combo to start QuickLaunch with Haiku's \
Shortcuts preferences.
