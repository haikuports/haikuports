SUMMARY="Spatially map your display to navigate windows \
with the keyboard"
DESCRIPTION="BamKeys let's you break your display up into \
a grid of zones. Each zone is assigned a keyboard combination. \

Whenever you press that keyboard combination, BamKeys will focus \
the front-most window that intersects with that zone, regardless \
of the program it belongs to! Pressing the same zone's keyboard \
combination repeatedly will focus widows further back. If you have \
three windows that intersect a zone, pressing that zones hotkey three \
times will cycle through all those windows. \

Configuring - \
Open up the BamKeys Application (it's a preference tool) At this point, \
you'll see a little display with a 3x3 grid, a check box, two pop up \
menus, and a bunch of key cap looking things. \

The default key mappings for this 3x3 grid are: the left "command" (or alt) \
key + numeric keypad 1 through 9 (with NumLock ON). If you'd like to \
change these settings you can - \

• Using the mouse: \
1. Click the zone on the little display you want to change. It will darken. \
2. Press (and release) the key combination you want to use. \
3. Click the zone again to de-select it. \

• Using the keyboard: \
1. Tab until the screen is selected. \
2. Press the space-bar. A zone will darken in the grid. \
3. You can use the arrow keys to change the selected zone. \
4. Pressing (and releasing) a keyboard shortcut will set the hotkey for that zone. \
5. Pressing space bar will unselect all zones."
