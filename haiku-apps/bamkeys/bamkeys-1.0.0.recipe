SUMMARY="An input_server filter for Haiku that \
lets you spatially map your display for navigating \
windows with your keyboard"
DESCRIPTION="BamKeys is an input_server filter for \
Haiku that lets you spatially map your display for \
navigating windows with your keyboard. BamKeys let's you \
break your display up into a grid of zones. Each zone \
is assigned a keyboard combination. Whenever you press \
that keyboard combination, BamKeys will focus \
the front-most window that intersects with that zone, \
regardless of the program it belongs to! Pressing the \
same zone's keyboard combination repeatedly will focus \
windows further back. If you have three windows that \
intersect a zone, pressing that zones hotkey three times \
will cycle through all those windows."
