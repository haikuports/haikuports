SUMMARY="Spatially map your display to navigate windows with the keyboard"
DESCRIPTION="BamKeys lets you break your display up into \
a grid of zones. Each zone is assigned a keyboard combination.
Whenever you press that keyboard combination, BamKeys will focus \
the front-most window that intersects with that zone, regardless \
of the program it belongs to! Pressing the same zone's keyboard \
combination repeatedly will focus widows further back. If you have \
three windows that intersect a zone, pressing that zones hotkey three \
times will cycle through all those windows.

Configuring -
Open up the BamKeys Preferences, you'll see a little display with a 3x3 \
grid, a check box, two pop up menus, and a bunch of key cap looking \
things.
The default key mappings for this 3x3 grid are: the left \"command"\ (or alt) \
key + numeric keypad 1 through 9 (with NumLock ON). These settings can be \
changed by:

• Using the mouse:
1. Click the zone on the little display you want to change. It will darken.
2. Press (and release) the key combination you want to use.
3. Click the zone again to de-select it.

• Using the keyboard:
1. Tab until the screen is selected.
2. Press the space-bar. A zone will darken in the grid.
3. You can use the arrow keys to change the selected zone.
4. Pressing (and releasing) a keyboard shortcut will set the hotkey for \
that zone.
5. Pressing space bar will unselect all zones."
