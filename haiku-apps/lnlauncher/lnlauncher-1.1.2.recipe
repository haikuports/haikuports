SUMMARY="Yet another launcher app"
DESCRIPTION="Yet another launcher app. This one docks to the screen edge, and \
has a neat drag n drop interface.

When minimized the app shouldn't get in your way, the only thing you see is \
the tiny handle.

Various localization files can be downloaded from the homepage, and if you \
want to add your own just mail it to me and I'll put it up with the rest!

The latest version, 1.1.2, was adapted for Haiku by Daniel Weber - thank you!"
