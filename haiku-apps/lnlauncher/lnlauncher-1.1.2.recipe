SUMMARY="A tool to launch applications"
DESCRIPTION="LnLauncher is yet another launcher app. This one docks to the \
screen edge, and has a neat drag'n'drop interface.
When minimized, the app shouldn't get in your way, the only thing you see is \
the tiny handle.

The latest version, 1.1.2, was adapted for Haiku by Daniel Weber - thank you!"
