SUMMARY="An application to adjust the properties of open windows"
DESCRIPTION="WindowTailor is an application which allows you to adjust the properties of open windows.
It is primarily intended to be launched by assigning keyboard shortcuts from the Shortcuts \
application, but can also be used from a shell or in scripts.

The application allows you to change:
 * Workspaces (including pinning/unpinning from all)
 * Window look
 * Window type
 * Window flags
 * Basic tiling of size/position
   Tiling is a work-in-progress feature and needs improvement in calculating sizes and accounting for window
   frames.

WindowTailor accepts command line arguments for all of these properties as well as a few extra \
(like zoom, minimize, send to back, ...)"
