SUMMARY="An application to adjust the properties of open windows"
DESCRIPTION="WindowTailor is an application which allows you to adjust the properties of open \
windows. It is primarily intended to be launched by assigning keyboard shortcuts from the \
Shortcuts preference application, but can also be used from a shell or in scripts.  Creating a \
keyboard shortcut with no extra command arguments will open the main interface of the application \
and allow you to manage the currently active window.

WindowTailor allows you to change:
 * Visibile workspaces
 * Window look
 * Window type
 * Window flags
 * Basic tiling of size/position

WindowTailor also accepts command line arguments for all of these properties as well as a few \
extra (like zoom, minimize, send to back, ...).  This allows you to set up keyboard shortcuts for \
frequently used actions.

For example:
 * a shortcut to pin/unpin windows from all workspaces with the --pintoggle argument
 * window tiling shortcuts that are mapped to the number pad of a keyboard
 * more convenient shortcuts for commands like minimize/zoom/sendtoback
