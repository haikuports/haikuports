SUMMARY="Play back audio samples via MIDI"
DESCRIPTION="Samedi is a little app to load audio samples into up to 8 pads and assign them \
to MIDI notes. The samples can then be played back by pressing the set key on your MIDI \
keyboard. Alternatively, Samedi also reacts to the number keys on your computer keyboard.

A set of 8 audio samples and their mapped MIDI note can be saved as 'Ensemble'.

IMPORTANT: If you experience relatively long delays between hitting a key and hearing a \
sound, your sound driver's buffers may be too large. See Samedi's Help how to solve this \
issue."
