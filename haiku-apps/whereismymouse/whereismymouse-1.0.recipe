SUMMARY="Find your mouse pointer with animated concentric circles"
DESCRIPTION="'Where Is My Mouse' is a little application that draws \
concentric circles around the mouse pointer. This can help finding it \
on the screen, especially when doing a presentations with a projector or \
on a laptop.

Use Haiku's Shortcuts preferences to set a key combination for the tool. 

Just run it to see the effect.
To change settings like number of circles, their width and the speed of the \
animation, run it from the Terminal with the "-s" parameter:

WhereIsMyMouse -s

This will open a settings panel to adjust those visuals. You can change the \
color of the circles by drag'n'dropping a color from an app like Colors!, \
Icon-O-Matic or WonderBrush onto the animation preview.
Settings are saved in ~/config/settings/WhereIsMyMouse_settings."
