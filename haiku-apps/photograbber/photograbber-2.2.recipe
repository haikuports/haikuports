SUMMARY="A tool to download/delete pictures from digital cameras"
DESCRIPTION="Photograbber has a plugin system which is based on the BDCP2 \
API created by Graham Wharton (Creator of 'Exposure!'). With this system \
it is possible to add support to more cameras. If you have developed a \
BCDP2 compatible plugin for your camera (or just found one somewhere), \
just copy it into the 'plugins' folder and PhotoGrabber will detect \
and use it.

At this moment PhotoGrabber only supports PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol) \
cameras. In the future Mass Storage and Bluethooth support may be added."
