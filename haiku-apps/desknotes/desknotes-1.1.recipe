SUMMARY="A tool to put simple sticky notes on the Desktop"
DESCRIPTION="
With DeskNotes you can leave little sticky notes all over your desktop, \
reminding you of things to do. The main difference between DeskNotes and \
other note utilities for Haiku is, that DeskNotes is designed to be used \
as a replicant. This means that when you tear a note from the DeskNotes \
application onto your desktop, it stays there! You don't have to save it \
before rebooting, or fiddle with your UserBootscript.
