SUMMARY="A tool to put simple sticky notes on the Desktop"
DESCRIPTION="With DeskNotes you can leave little sticky notes all over your \
Desktop, reminding you of things to do.
The main difference between DeskNotes and other note utilities is that \
DeskNotes is designed to be used as replicants. This means that when you tear \
a note from the DeskNotes application onto your Desktop, it stays there! You \
don't have to save it before rebooting, or fiddle with your UserBootscript.

You can choose different colors from a right-click context menu or drop \
arbitrary colors from applications like 'Icon-O-Matic' or 'Colors!'.
And, even as replicants, notes can be resized with the bottom-right resize \
widget."
