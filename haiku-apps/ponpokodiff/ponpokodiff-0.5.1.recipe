SUMMARY="A tool to compare text files"
DESCRIPTION="PonpokoDiff is a graphical file comparison utility. \
It compares two files and shows the differences graphically side-by-side. \
Lines that differ are highlighted yellow, additional lines are green, \
removed lines are red.

You can select two files in Tracker and choose PonpokoDiff from the 'Open with...' \
menu to compare them, or drag and drop files into the PonpokoDiff window. The app \
automatically keeps track of renamed and moved files and offers to reload files \
when their contents has changed."
