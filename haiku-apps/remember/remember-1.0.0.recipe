SUMMARY="A small app to remember scheduled events"
DESCRIPTION="\
Remember is a small app for Haiku, which allows you to get notifications about \
events easily, by adding files into an Events folder. It will automatically \
find those and, when the time you chose has arrived, it will pop up with a \
notification, warning you about the event."
