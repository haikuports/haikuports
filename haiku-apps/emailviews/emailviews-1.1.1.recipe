SUMMARY="Native query-based email client"
DESCRIPTION="A native fast, lightweight email client for Haiku that uses live queries \
to organize and explore your emails effortlessly.

EmailViews works with Haiku's built-in mail_daemon and mail kit — it reads emails already \
stored on disk as file attributes, so there is nothing to import or sync. Just point it \
at your mail and go."
