SUMMARY="Curses based hex editor"
DESCRIPTION="More than just another hex editor: It includes a diff mode, which can be used to \
easily and conveniently compare two binary files. Since it is based on ncurses and is themeable, \
it can run on any number of systems and scenarios. With its utilization of search logs, it is \
possible to track changes in different iterations of files easily."
