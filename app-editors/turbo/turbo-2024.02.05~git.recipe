SUMMARY="An experimental text editor based on Scintilla and Turbo Vision"
DESCRIPTION="Turbo is an experimental text editor for the terminal, based on the Scintilla code \
editing component by Neil Hodgson and the Turbo Vision application framework.

It was created to demonstrate new features in Turbo Vision. In particular, it has served as \
testing ground for Turbo Vision's Unicode capabilities.

As a text editor, Turbo aims at being intuitive and easy to use. Usability and productivity are \
its two other major objectives, although it has not got that far yet. And only for being a \
Turbo Vision application, it offers a vintage look and feel."
