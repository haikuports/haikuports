SUMMARY="A fork of FTE -- Folding Text Editor"
DESCRIPTION="Advanced lightweight configurable editor eFTE is an advanced \
programmers editor with goals of being lightweight, yet totally configurable.

Support for user defined programming languages, menu systems and key bindings \
are provided with many common defaults already defined.

eFTE is still a new project, however, extended from the FTE editor which was
first released in 1995, so eFTE is tried and true with many features for the
programmer/text editor."
