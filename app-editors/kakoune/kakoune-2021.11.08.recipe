SUMMARY="Modal code editor with a focus on interactivity"
DESCRIPTION="Kakoune is a code editor that implements Vi's \"keystrokes as a text \
editing language\" model.  As it's also a modal editor, it is somewhat \
similar to the Vim editor (after which Kakoune was originally inspired).

Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most commands provide \
immediate and incremental results, while still being competitive (as \
in keystroke count) with Vim.

Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of \
characters, selections have an anchor and a cursor character.  Most \
commands move both of them, except when extending selection where the \
anchor character stays fixed and the cursor one moves around."
