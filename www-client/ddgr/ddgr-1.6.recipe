SUMMARY="DuckDuckGo from the terminal"
DESCRIPTION="ddgr is a command-line tool to search DuckDuckGo. ddgr shows the \
title, URL and text context for each result. Results are fetched in pages. \
Keyboard shortcuts are available for page navigation. Results are indexed \
and a result URL can be opened in a browser using the index number. There is \
no configuration file as aliases serve the same purpose for this utility. \
Supports sequential searches in a single instance.

Features:

* Fast and clean (no ads, stray URLs or clutter), custom color
* Designed to deliver maximum readability at minimum space
* Specify the number of search results to show per page
* Navigate result pages from omniprompt, open URLs in browser
* Search and option completion scripts for Bash, Zsh and Fish
* DuckDuckGo Bang support (along with completion)
* Open the first result directly in browser (as in I'm Feeling Ducky)
* Non-stop searches: fire new searches at omniprompt without exiting
* Keywords (e.g. filetype:mime, site:somesite.com) support
* Limit search by time, specify region, disable safe search
* HTTPS proxy support, Do Not Track set, optionally disable User Agent
* Support custom url handler script or cmdline utility
* Comprehensive documentation, man page with handy usage examples
* Minimal dependencies"
