SUMMARY="The GNU Readline library"
DESCRIPTION="The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by \
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. \
Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes \
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, \
to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history \
expansion on previous commands.

The history facilites are also placed into a separate library, the History \
library, as part of the build process. The History library may be used without \
Readline in applications which desire its capabilities."
