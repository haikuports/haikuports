SUMMARY="Common structures and low-level operations"
DESCRIPTION="A C library (with some C++ bindings available) that provides data \
structures and functions commonly needed, such as maps, deques, linked lists, \
string formatting and autoresizing, option and config file parsing, type \
checking casts and more.

libHX aids in quickly writing up C and C++ data processing programs, by \
consolidating tasks that often happen to be open-coded, such as (simple) \
config file reading, option parsing, directory traversal, and others, into a \
library. The focus is on reducing the amount of time (and secondarily, the \
amount of code) a developer has to spend for otherwise implementing such."
