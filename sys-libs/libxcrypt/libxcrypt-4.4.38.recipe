SUMMARY="Extended crypt library for descrypt, md5crypt, bcrypt, and others"
DESCRIPTION="libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords. It supports a wide \
variety of both modern and historical hashing methods: yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, \
sha512crypt, sha256crypt, md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt. It \
provides the traditional Unix *crypt* and *crypt_r* interfaces, as well as a set of extended \
interfaces pioneered by Openwall Linux, *crypt_rn*, *crypt_ra*, *crypt_gensalt*, \
*crypt_gensalt_rn*, and *crypt_gensalt_ra*.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by *login(1)*, *passwd(1)*, and other similar programs; that \
is, to hash a small number of passwords during an interactive authentication dialogue with a \
human. It is not suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any other \
situation where speed is more important than careful handling of sensitive data.  However, it \
*is* intended to be fast and lightweight enough for use in servers that must field thousands of \
login attempts per minute."
