SUMMARY="A library for solution of nonsymmetric systems of linear equations"
DESCRIPTION="SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution \
of large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations. The library is \
written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran program. It uses MPI, \
OpenMP and CUDA to support various forms of parallelism. It supports both \
real and complex datatypes, both single and double precision, and 64-bit \
integer indexing. The library routines performs an LU decomposition with \
partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back \
substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square matrices \
but the triangular solves are performed only for square matrices. The matrix \
columns may be preordered (before factorization) either through library or \
user supplied routines. This preordering for sparsity is completely separate \
from the factorization. Working precision iterative refinement subroutines \
are provided for improved backward stability. Routines are also provided \
to equilibrate the system, estimate the condition number, calculate the \
relative backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions. \
Serial SuperLU package also contains ILU routines, using numerical \
threshold-based dropping, with partial pivoting (ILUTP)."
