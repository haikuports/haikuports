As a special exception to the GNU General Public License terms,
permission is hereby granted to link the code of this program, with or
without modification, with any version of the OpenSSL library and/or any
version of unRAR, and to distribute such linked combinations.  You must
obey the GNU GPL in all respects for all of the code used other than
OpenSSL and unRAR.  If you modify this program, you may extend this
exception to your version of the program, but you are not obligated to
do so.  (In other words, you may release your derived work under pure
GNU GPL version 2 or later as published by the FSF.)

(This exception from the GNU GPL is not required for the core tree of
John the Ripper, but arguably it is required for -jumbo.)


	Relaxed terms for certain components.

In addition or alternatively to the license above, many components are
available to you under more relaxed terms (most commonly under cut-down
BSD license) as specified in the corresponding source files.

Furthermore, as the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based
password hashing) implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed
a derived version of this implementation in the public domain.  This
derived version may be obtained at:

	http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).


	Commercial licensing.

Commercial licenses (non-GPL) are available upon request.


	Copyright holder contact information.

(There are additional copyright holders for "community enhanced" -jumbo
versions of John the Ripper.)
