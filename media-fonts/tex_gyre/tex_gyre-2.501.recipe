SUMMARY="TeX Fonts extending freely available URW fonts"
DESCRIPTION="The TEX-GYRE bundle consists of six font families:
TeX Gyre Adventor is based on the URW Gothic L family of fonts (which is \
derived from ITC Avant Garde Gothic, designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom \
Carnase).
TeX Gyre Bonum is based on the URW Bookman L family (from Bookman Old Style, \
designed by Alexander Phemister).
TeX Gyre Chorus is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic (from ITC Zapf \
Chancery, designed by Hermann Zapf in 1979).
TeX-Gyre Cursor is based on URW Nimbus Mono L (based on Courier, designed by \
Howard G. Kettler in 1955, for IBM).
TeX Gyre Heros is based on URW Nimbus Sans L (from Helvetica, prepared by Max \
Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann in 1957).
TeX Gyre Pagella is based on URW Palladio L (from Palatino, designed by \
Hermann Zapf in the 1940s).
TeX Gyre Schola is based on the URW Century Schoolbook L family (from Century \
Schoolbook, designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders).
TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family of fonts (from \
Times New Roman, designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess \
and Victor Lardent and first offered by Monotype).
The constituent standard faces of each family have been greatly extended \
(though Chorus omits Greek support and has no small-caps family)."
