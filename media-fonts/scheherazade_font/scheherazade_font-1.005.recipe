SUMMARY="Arabic script font"
DESCRIPTION="Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian \
Nights tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such \
as Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family \
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any \
Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font \
technologies to support complex typographic issues.
This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic \
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures \
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This \
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic \
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and \
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
- Scheherazade Regular
This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character \
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not \
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType \
technology."
