SUMMARY="A monospaced font family built with the needs of developers in mind"
DESCRIPTION="Introducing Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family that’s built with \
clarity, legibility, and the needs of developers in mind.

It’s easier to read, and available for free, with an open-source font license.

Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer audience, Frere-Jones Type \
designed the Intel One Mono typeface in partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&R, for \
maximum legibility to address developers' fatigue and eyestrain and reduce coding errors. A \
panel of low-vision and legally blind developers provided feedback at each stage of design.

Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200 languages using the Latin script. The Intel \
One Mono fonts are provided in four weights — Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold — with matching \
italics, and we are happy to share both an official release of fonts ready to use as well as \
editable sources."
