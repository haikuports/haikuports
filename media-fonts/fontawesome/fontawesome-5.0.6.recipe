SUMMARY="A font containing scalable vector icons"
DESCRIPTION="FontAwesome contains over 600 icons and is most widely used on \
the internet to depict certain actions. Haiku's discussion forum at \

As long as Haiku doesn't support loading a font that's not installed, you \
should install this webfont to see all the icons on the discussion forum."
