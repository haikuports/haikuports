SUMMARY="The Android Roboto font"
DESCRIPTION="\
The Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools such as \
scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid. Successful \
deployment of these tools is essential to help users quickly understand a \
screen of information. To support such use of typography, Ice Cream Sandwich \
introduced a new type family named Roboto, created specifically for the \
requirements of UI and high-resolution screens.
The current TextView framework offers Roboto in thin, light, regular and bold \
weights, along with an italic style for each weight. The framework also offers \
the Roboto Condensed variant in regular and bold weights, along with an italic \
style for each weight.
