SUMMARY="The Clear Sans font"
DESCRIPTION="Clear Sans has been recognized as a versatile OpenType font for \
screen, print, and Web. Clear Sans was designed with on-screen legibility \
in mind. It strikes a balance between contemporary, professional, and stylish \
expression and thoroughly functional purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant \
personality at all sizes, and its thoughtful design becomes even more evident at \
the thin weight."
