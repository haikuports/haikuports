SUMMARY="A variable font family for code & UI"
DESCRIPTION="Recursive Mono & Sans is a variable type family built for better \
code & UI. It is inspired by casual script signpainting, but designed \
primarily to meet the needs of programming environments and application \
interfaces.

In programming, “recursion” is when a function calls itself, using its own \
output as an input to yield powerful results. Recursive Mono was used as a \
tool to help build itself: it was used to write Python scripts to automate \
type production work and to generate specimen images, and it was used in \
HTML, CSS, and JS to create web-based proofs & prototypes. Through this \
active usage, Recursive Mono was crafted to be both fun to look at as well \
as deeply useful for all-day work.

Recursive Sans borrows glyphs from its parent mono but adjusts the widths \
of many key glyphs for comfortable readability. Its metrics are superplexed \
– every style takes up the exact same horizontal space, across all styles. \
In this 3-axis variable font, this allows for fluid transitions between \
weight, slant, and “expression” (casual to strict letterforms), all without \
text shifts or layout reflow. Not only does this allow for new interactive \
possibilities in UI, but it also makes for a uniquely fun typesetting \
experience."
