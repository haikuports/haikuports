SUMMARY="Arabic font for Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region"
DESCRIPTION="Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous \
Sindhi mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use \
in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic \
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures \
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This \
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic \
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and \
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
* Lateef Regular

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character \
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not \
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType \
technology."
