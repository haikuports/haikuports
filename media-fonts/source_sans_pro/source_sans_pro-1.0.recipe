SUMMARY="The Source Sans Pro Font"
DESCRIPTION="\
Source Sans Pro was designed by Paul D. Hunt under the guidance of Robert Slimbach. \
It is Adobe's first open source typeface family, conceived primarily as a typeface  \
for user interfaces. Source Sans Pro draws inspiration from the clarity and legibility \
of twentieth-century American gothic typeface designs. Distilling the best \
archetypical qualities of these models, Paul followed a rational design approach by \
simplifying glyph shapes by paring them to their essential form. However, in order \
to more easily differentiate similar letter shapes (such as uppercase I and lowercase L), \
some additional details have been added. Besides providing such explicitly \
clarity in short text strings, another fundamental design consideration was to create \
a typeface that reads well in extended settings. This can be seen in the general \
proportions: Source Sans Pro has been designed with a more generous width than many \
other comparable gothics, and its shorter majuscule letters, combined with minuscule \
letters with longer extenders, create a more pleasant reading texture in longer text passages.
