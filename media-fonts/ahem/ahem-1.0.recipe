SUMMARY="A font developed to help test writers develop predictable tests"
DESCRIPTION="The Ahem font was developed by Todd Fahrner to help test writers \
develop predictable tests. The font's em square is exactly square. \
Its ascent and descent is exactly the size of the em square. This \
means that the font's extent is exactly the same as its line-height, \
meaning that it can be exactly aligned with padding, borders, margins, \
and so forth.
The font's alphabetic baseline is 0.2em above its bottom, and 0.8em \
below its top. The font has an x-height of 0.8em.

The font has four glyphs:
- 'X' U+0058 A square exactly 1em in height and width.
- 'p' U+0070 A rectangle exactly 0.2em high, 1em wide, and aligned so \
that its top is flush with the baseline.
- 'Ã‰' U+00C9 A rectangle exactly 0.8em high, 1em wide, and aligned so \
that its bottom is flush with the baseline.
- ' ' U+0020 A transparent space exactly 1em high and wide.

Most other US-ASCII characters in the font have the same glyph as X."
