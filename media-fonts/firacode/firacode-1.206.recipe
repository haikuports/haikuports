SUMMARY="Monospaced font with programming ligatures"
DESCRIPTION="Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several \
characters. For the human brain, sequences like ->, <= or := are single \
logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. \
Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple \
characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages \
should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but \
that’s not the case yet.
Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of \
ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just \
a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This \
helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like \
.. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing."
