SUMMARY="The Fira font"
DESCRIPTION="\
Designed to integrate with the character of Mozilla's Firefox OS, the \
Fira Sans typeface also aims to cover the legibility needs for a large range of \
handsets varying in screen quality and rendering. When working with Fira Sans \
it is recommended that micro font sizes that fall below our guidelines are avoided.
This also includes the Fira Mono typeface.
