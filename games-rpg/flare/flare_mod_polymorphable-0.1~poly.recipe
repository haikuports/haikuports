SUMMARY="Free/Libre Action Roleplaying Engine - Laurelia's Polymorphable Citizen"
DESCRIPTION="Originally created for the 2012 Liberated Pixel Cup, this game is based upon \
Clint Bellanger's FLARE engine. Our goal is to create a game which draws upon several \
different classics in the genre, with a heavy emphasis on a polymorphable main character.

Laurelia's Polymorphable Citizen (or just Polymorphable for short) is an action-rpg \
based on the Flare engine. We're aiming a little more towards an 8-bit adventure classic \
feel, only with more RPG aspects (ie. attribute choices on level up!)

The core mechanic in Polymorphable is using different talismans to polymorph into different \
forms so you can reach different areas. Imagine being blocked by a pit, so you transform \
into a bat to fly across. Or perhaps there's a wall of fire in front of you, so you turn \
into ghost form to phase right through."
