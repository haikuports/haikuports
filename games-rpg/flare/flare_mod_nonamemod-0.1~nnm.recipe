SUMMARY="Free/Libre Action Roleplaying Engine - Noname mod"
DESCRIPTION="This is an as yet nameless mod for Clint Bellangers Flare engine. The basic goals are \
to create a small game which will work on the v1 flare engine, which can be completed with an \
achievable scope, which shows off some of the newer engine features and shows off some of the \
previously unused flare art from opengameart.org."
