SUMMARY="An alternative client for id Software's Quake II"
DESCRIPTION="Yamagi Quake II is an alternative client for id Software's Quake \
II. Our goal is to provide the best Quake II experience possible, we strive \
to preserve the gameplay as it was back in 1997. Thus we aim mostly for bug \
fixes, stability and gentle enhancements where appropriate.

The binary will look for data folders (like 'baseq2' and 'music') in \
'/boot/home/config/settings/yq2'

(Note: 'native fullscreen' in Haiku crashes on exit and when switching mods, \
playing in windowed mode is recommended. You can load mods on startup using \
'Quake2 +set game modname' from command line if you prefer fullscreen)

Yamagi Quake II has a lot of unique features. The most notables ones are:

* A modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer, providing a greatly enhanced look and feel. \
The original OpenGL 1.4 and even the Software renderers are still supported. \
Both 3D accelerated renderers support anisotropic filtering and multisampling \
anti aliasing.
* Full support for widescreen displays and arbitrary resolutions. \
The HUD can be scaled to be readable on high resolutions.
* Support for surround sound, from stereo up to 7.1 channels and even HRTF. \
The background music can be played from OGG/Vorbis files, a CD drive is no \
longer necessary.
* A rewritten savegame system. Yamagi Quake II savegames are completely \
reliable and backward compatible between releases.
* Highly precise timings. For example, on a flat panel display with a 59.95 \
hertz refresh rate and vertical synchronisation (VSync) enabled Yamagi Quake \
II is running at exactly 59.95 frames per second.
* In comparison with the original client over 1.500 bugs were fixed. The \
Yamagi Quake II client is very well tested and stable. The dedicated server \
is able to run for weeks without a single restart. Last but not least the \
code is fully 64 bit clean and highly portable."
