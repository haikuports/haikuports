description = "A port of the tyrquake engine, which is based on iD's open source Quake engine, to libretro. While remaining relatively conservative and true-to-the-original, this core provides the additional features of running at fixed framerates (with interpolated animations applied on the keyframe for smooth animation at greater-than-original framerates), software bilinear filtering, software Half-Life/Quake 2-style colored lighting RGBA and third-person view mode. Check the libretro documentation for an explanation on the directory structure required to load BGM files, etc."
