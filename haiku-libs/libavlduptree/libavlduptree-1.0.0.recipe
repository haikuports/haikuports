SUMMARY="A set of C subroutines for indexing sets of key/value pairs"
DESCRIPTION="AVLDupTree is a set of C subroutines (not C++, so you can use it \
in drivers) that is useful for indexing a set of key/value pairs, using the \
key to find a matching value.
The standard AVL balanced binary tree algorithm is enhanced to support \
multiple values for the same key.  It is designed for future use in a file \
system to support fast attribute indexing and queries, but you can use it for \
other things. This package also includes the AGMSAVLTest GUI App. It tests \
the operations on the tree, provided by libavlduptree."
