SUMMARY="Scalable distributed programming environment"
DESCRIPTION="SockHop is a system that facilitates the development of applications \
that run on many machines at once. It is implemented in a single \
file (libsockhop.so) that serves as both shared library for client code, \
and as a server program for remote program invocation and control. SockHop's \
primary design goals are ease of use, flexibility, and scalability \
Using SockHop, writing and debugging a program that runs on many machines \
at once is not much harder than writing a \"regular\" multithreaded program."
