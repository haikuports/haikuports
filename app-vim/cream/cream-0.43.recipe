SUMMARY="A modern configuration of the Vim text editor"
DESCRIPTION="Vim is a powerful and full-featured text editor, the popular \
descendant of the 1976 Vi text editor.

But Vim has a steep learning curve. It was not primarily designed to be easy \
to use, favoring performance and technical flexibility instead. Because it is \
so different, learning to use Vim takes time.

Cream shapes Vim into an interface you probably already know (sometimes called \
Common User Access). Whether you are writing emails or developing large \
software applications, Cream saves you time and gets you up and running quickly."
