SUMMARY="a modern configuration of the Vim text editor"
DESCRIPTION="
Vim is a powerful and full-featured text editor, the popular descendant of the \
1976 Vi text editor.

But Vim has a steep learning curve. It was not primarily designed to be easy to \
use, favoring performance and technical flexibility instead. Because it is so \
different, learning to use Vim takes time.

Cream shapes Vim into an interface you probably already know (sometimes called \
Common User Access). Whether you are writing emails or developing large \
software applications, Cream saves you time and gets you up and running quickly.
