SUMMARY="A high quality General Midi Soundfont"
DESCRIPTION="GeneralUser GS is a GM and GS compatible SoundFont bank for \
composing, playing MIDI files, and retro gaming. It features 259 instrument \
presets and 11 drum kits, all while possessing a very low memory footprint \
(less than 30 MB of RAM).
Due to its clever, detailed sound programming, GeneralUser GS can sound as \
good or better than SoundFonts that are 2-3 times its size.

GeneralUser GS requires a SoundFont synth with support for SoundFont 2.01 \
modulators.
Compatible synths include FluidSynth 1.0.9 or later (and other software that \
uses FluidSynth such as Qsynth, LMMS, and ScummVM, just to name a few), \
MuseScore 2.0.3 or later, SynthFont2 2.0.3.0 or later, and VSTSynthFont 1.080 \
or later.

You can select the active SoundFont in Haiku's Media preferences.
For the mapping of the percussion instruments, see the 'documentation' folder."
