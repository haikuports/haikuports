SUMMARY="A tool for distributed software configuration management"
DESCRIPTION="Fossil is a simple, high-reliability, distributed version \
control system like Git and Mercurial, but Fossil also supports distributed \
bug tracking, distributed wiki, and a distributed blog mechanism all in a \
single integrated package.

Additionally, Fossil also has a built-in and easy-to-use web interface that \
simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness."
