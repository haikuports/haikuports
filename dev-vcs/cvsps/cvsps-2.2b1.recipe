SUMMARY="Generate patch sets from a CVS repository"
DESCRIPTION="
CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS \
repository.  A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made \
to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a \
single 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable to seeing the \
big picture of the evolution of a cvs project.  While cvs tracks revision \
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed \
'atomically' to the repository."
