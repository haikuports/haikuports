SUMMARY="Convert files into tape images for Amstrad computers"
DESCRIPTION="2CDT is a utility to transfer files into a .CDT Tape-Image.
A .CDT is a tape-image file which describes the data stored on a cassette \
tape. This file format is very powerful and can describe fast and custom \
loaders as well as standard operating system formats.

The .CDT file format is identical to the .TZX format. The extension is \
used to differentiate between Spectrum and Amstrad Tape-Images.
The .TZX file format was originally designed to store Spectrum tape \
programs, its format can be found from various sources, one of these is \
\"World Of Spectrum\": http://www.void.jump.org/.

There are a number of tools which already create .TZX files: Taper, Voc2TZX \
and MakeTZX. However, these are designed to recognise Spectrum tape loaders, \
and so do not do well at creating a tape-image for Amstrad formats.

2CDT has been designed as a starting point for further Amstrad CDT tools, \
and as a program to generate reference tape-images which can be used by \
emulator authors to support this tape-image format in their programs.

This tool is designed to \"inject\" one or more file into a .CDT in the \
format written  by the Amstrad operating system. The tool allows the user to
define the .CDT \"recording\" method and baud rate."
