SUMMARY="Lightweight multi-target assembler/disassembler"
DESCRIPTION="Lightweight assembler / disassembler with a focus on being easy \
to compile (no dependencies) and easy to use. It was originally called \
naken430asm, but since it has been expanded it to support many more CPUs it \
has been renamed to naken_asm. Additionally, there is also a simulator for \
some of the supported CPUs."
