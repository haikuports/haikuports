SUMMARY="MC680x0 / 68851 reassembler"
DESCRIPTION="When I was in need for a portable M68k reassembler I remembered Tim Ruehsen's \
IRA source, and put some effort into it to make it portable to any \
architecture and to any compiler. Parts were taken from Ilkka Lehtoranta's \
MorphOS port of IRA 1.05, who already cleaned the code from all SAS/C \
dependencies. But most effort was put into making the reassembler \
endian-independant."
