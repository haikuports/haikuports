SUMMARY="A Device Firmware Update based USB programmer for Atmel chips"
DESCRIPTION="dfu-programmer is an implementation of the Device Firmware \
Upgrade class USB driver that enables firmware upgrades for various USB \
enabled (with the correct bootloader) Atmel chips.  This program was created \
because the Atmel "FLIP" program for flashing devices does not support \
flashing via USB on Linux, and because standard DFU loaders do not work for \
Atmel's chips.

Check out the Atmel website for more information.  They are kind enough to \
provide generally correct specifications this implementation is based on.

The project website is http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net and you can use \
that to check for updates."
