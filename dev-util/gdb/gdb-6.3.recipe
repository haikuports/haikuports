SUMMARY="The GNU debugger"
DESCRIPTION="GDB is the GNU debugger. It allows you to see what is going on \
'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was \
doing at the moment it crashed.

GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of \
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

 * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
 * Make your program stop on specified conditions.
 * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
 * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting \
the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

The program being debugged can be written in Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, \
Pascal (and many other languages). Those programs might be executing \
on the same machine as GDB (native) or on another machine (remote). \
GDB can run on most popular UNIX and Microsoft Windows variants."
