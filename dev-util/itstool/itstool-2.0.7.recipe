SUMMARY="Translate your XML documents with PO files"
DESCRIPTION="ITS Tool allows you to translate your XML documents with PO \
files, using rules from the W3C Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) to \
determine what to translate and how to separate it into PO file messages.

PO files are the standard translation format for GNU and other Unix-like \
systems. They present translatable information as discrete messages, allowing \
each message to be translated independently. In contrast to whole-page \
translation, translating with a message-based format like PO means you can \
easily track changes to the source document down to the paragraph. When new \
strings are added or existing strings are modified, you only need to update \
the corresponding messages.

ITS Tool is designed to make XML documents translatable through PO files by \
applying standard ITS rules, as well as extension rules specific to ITS Tool. \
ITS also provides an industry standard way for authors to override translation \
information in their documents, such as whether a particular element should be \
translated."
