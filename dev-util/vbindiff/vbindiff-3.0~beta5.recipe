SUMMARY="Visual Binary Diff"
DESCRIPTION="VBinDiff (Visual Binary Diff) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII (or EBCDIC). \
It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences between them. Unlike diff, \
it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).

VBinDiff was inspired by the Compare Files function of the ProSel utilities by Glen Bredon, for \
the Apple II. When I couldn’t find a similar utility for the PC, I wrote it myself.

The single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility of 4DOS and friends. While less provides a \
good line-oriented display, it has no equivalent to LIST’s hex display. (True, you can pipe the \
file through hexdump, but that’s incredibly inefficient on multi-gigabyte files.)."
