SUMMARY="American fuzzy lop, a security-oriented fuzzer"
DESCRIPTION="American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a \
novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to \
automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new \
internal states in the targeted binary. This substantially improves the \
functional coverage for the fuzzed code. The compact synthesized corpora \
produced by the tool are also useful for seeding other, more labor- or \
resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.

Compared to other instrumented fuzzers, afl-fuzz is designed to be practical: \
it has modest performance overhead, uses a variety of highly effective \
fuzzing strategies and effort minimization tricks, requires essentially no \
configuration, and seamlessly handles complex, real-world use cases - say, \
common image parsing or file compression libraries."
