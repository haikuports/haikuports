 Description: Gertty
         ======
-        
+
         Gertty is a console-based interface to the Gerrit Code Review system.
-        
+
         As compared to the web interface, the main advantages are:
-        
+
          * Workflow -- the interface is designed to support a workflow similar
            to reading network news or mail.  In particular, it is designed to
            deal with a large number of review requests across a large number
            of projects.
-        
+
          * Offline Use -- Gertty syncs information about changes in subscribed
            projects to a local database and local git repos.  All review
            operations are performed against that database and then synced back
            to Gerrit.
-        
+
          * Speed -- user actions modify locally cached content and need not
            wait for server interaction.
-        
+
          * Convenience -- because Gertty downloads all changes to local git
            repos, a single command instructs it to checkout a change into that
            repo for detailed examination or testing of larger changes.
-        
+
         Installation
         ------------
-        
+
         Debian
         ~~~~~~
-        
+
         Gertty is packaged in Debian and is currently available in:
-        
+
          * unstable
          * testing
          * stable
-        
+
         You can install it with::
-        
+
           apt-get install gertty
-        
+
         Fedora
         ~~~~~~
-        
+
         Gertty is packaged starting in Fedora 21.  You can install it with::
-        
+
           dnf install python-gertty
-        
+
         openSUSE
         ~~~~~~~~
-        
+
         Gertty is packaged for openSUSE 13.1 onwards.  You can install it via
         `1-click install from the Open Build Service <http://software.opensuse.org/package/python-gertty>`_.
-        
+
         Gentoo
         ~~~~~~
-        
+
         Gertty is available in the main Gentoo repository.  You can install it with::
-        
+
           emerge gertty
-        
+
         Arch Linux
         ~~~~~~~~~~
-        
+
         Gertty packages are available in the Arch User Repository packages. You
         can get the package from::
-        
+
           https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-gertty/
-        
+
         Source
         ~~~~~~
-        
+
         When installing from source, it is recommended (but not required) to
         install Gertty in a virtualenv.  To set one up::
-        
+
           virtualenv gertty-env
           source gertty-env/bin/activate
-        
+
         To install the latest version from the cheeseshop::
-        
+
           pip install gertty
-        
+
         To install from a git checkout::
-        
+
           pip install .
-        
+
         Gertty uses a YAML based configuration file that it looks for at
         ``~/.config/gertty/gertty.yaml``.  Several sample configuration files
         are included.  You can find them in the examples/ directory of the
         `source distribution
         <https://opendev.org/ttygroup/gertty/src/branch/master/examples>`_ or
-        the share/gertty/examples directory after installation.

         Select one of the sample config files, copy it to
         ~/.config/gertty/gertty.yaml and edit as necessary.  Search for
         ``CHANGEME`` to find parameters that need to be supplied.  The sample
         config files are as follows:
-

         **minimal-gertty.yaml**
           Only contains the parameters required for Gertty to actually run.

           Gerrit.

         The config file is designed to support multiple Gerrit instances.  The
         first one is used by default, but others can be specified by supplying
         the name on the command line.
-        
+
         Usage
         -----
-        
+
         After installing Gertty, you should be able to run it by invoking
         ``gertty``.  If you installed it in a virtualenv, you can invoke it
         without activating the virtualenv with ``/path/to/venv/bin/gertty``
         which you may wish to add to your shell aliases.  Use ``gertty
         --help`` to see a list of command line options available.
-        
+
         Once Gertty is running, you will need to start by subscribing to some
         projects.  Use 'L' to list all of the projects and then 's' to
         subscribe to the ones you are interested in.  Hit 'L' again to shrink
         the list to your subscribed projects.
-        
+
         In general, pressing the F1 key will show help text on any screen, and
         ESC will take you to the previous screen.
-        
+
         Gertty works seamlessly offline or online.  All of the actions that it
         performs are first recorded in a local database (in ``~/.gertty.db``
         by default), and are then transmitted to Gerrit.  If Gertty is unable
         to contact Gerrit for any reason, it will continue to operate against
         the local database, and once it re-establishes contact, it will
         process any pending changes.
-        
+
         The status bar at the top of the screen displays the current number of
         outstanding tasks that Gertty must perform in order to be fully up to
         date.  Some of these tasks are more complicated than others, and some
         of them will end up creating new tasks (for instance, one task may be
         to search for new changes in a project which will then produce 5 new
         tasks if there are 5 new changes).
-        
+
         If Gertty is offline, it will so indicate in the status bar.  It will
         retry requests if needed, and will switch between offline and online
         mode automatically.
-        
+
         If you review a change while offline with a positive vote, and someone
         else leaves a negative vote on that change in the same category before
         Gertty is able to upload your review, Gertty will detect the situation

         explicitly un-held in this manner for your review to be uploaded.
-

         If Gertty encounters an error, this will also be indicated in the
         status bar.  You may wish to examine ~/.gertty.log to see what the
         error was.  In many cases, Gertty can continue after encountering an

         The MacOS terminal blocks ctrl+o, which is the default search key combo in
         Gertty. To fix this, a custom keymap can be used on MacOS which modifies the
         search key combo. For example::

           keymaps:

         If you use rxvt-unicode, you can add something like the following to
         ``.Xresources`` to make Gerrit URLs that are displayed in your
         terminal (perhaps in an email or irc client) clickable links that open

         The MacOS terminal blocks ctrl+o, which is the default search key combo in
         Gertty. To fix this, a custom keymap can be used on MacOS which modifies the
         search key combo. For example::
-

           keymaps:
             - name: default # MacOS blocks ctrl+o
