SUMMARY="Various packaging tools and scripts for LXQt applications"
DESCRIPTION="This package provides several tools needed to build LXQt itself \
as well as other components maintained by the LXQt project.

These tools used to be spread over the repositories of various other \
components and were summarized to ease dependency management. So far \
many components, in particular liblxqt, were representing a build \
dependency without being needed themselves but only because their \
repository was providing a subset of the tools which are now \
summarized here. So the use of this repository will reduce \
superfluous and bloated dependencies."
