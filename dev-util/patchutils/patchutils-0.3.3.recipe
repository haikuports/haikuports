SUMMARY="A small collection of programs that operate on patch files."
DESCRIPTION="
	*Interdiff generates an incremental patch from two patches
	 against a common source.
	*Combinediff generates a single patch from two incremental
	 patches, allowing you to merge patches together.
	*Filterdiff will select the portions of a patch file that apply
	 to files matching (or, alternatively, not matching) a shell
	 wildcard.
	*Fixcvsdiff is for correcting the output of ‘cvs diff’.
	*Rediff corrects hand-edited patches, by comparing the original
	 patch with the modified one and adjusting the offsets and
	 counts.
	*Lsdiff displays a short listing of affected files in a patch
	 file, along with (optionally) the line numbers of the start of
	 each patch.
	*Splitdiff separates out patches from a patch file so that each
	 new patch file only alters any given file once.
	*Grepdiff displays a list of the files modified by a patch where
	 the patch contains a given regular expression.
	*Recountdiff fixes up counts and offsets in a unified diff.
	*Unwrapdiff fixes word-wrapped unified diffs.
