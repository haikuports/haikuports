SUMMARY="A fast and flexible build system"
DESCRIPTION="Bam uses Lua to describe the build process. It's takes its \
inspiration for the script files from scons. While scons focuses on being \
100% correct when building, bam makes a few sacrifices to acquire fast. \
full and incremental build times."
