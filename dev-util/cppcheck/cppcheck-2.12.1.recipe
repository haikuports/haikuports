SUMMARY="A static analysis tool for C/C++ code"
DESCRIPTION="Cppcheck provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and focuses on \
detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. The goal is \
to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have very few false positives).

Features:
* Unique code analysis that detect various kinds of bugs in your code.
* Both command line interface and graphical user interface are available.
* Cppcheck has a strong focus on detecting undefined behaviour."
