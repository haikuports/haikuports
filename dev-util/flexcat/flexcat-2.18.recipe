SUMMARY="Flexible Catalogs for Amiga Systems"
DESCRIPTION="A tool to create Amiga localization catalogs (*.catalog files) similar to what the \
good-old CatComp tool does. However, it can also create source and header files for developers \
and can be used on other platforms (Unix, Windows, etc.), thus is cross-platform aware.
The difference between FlexCat and KitCat, CatComp and some others is, that FlexCat is designed \
to produce any source you want: any programming language, any individual needs should be \
satisfied. However, FlexCat is not more difficult to use. This sounds like a contradiction. \
FlexCat's solution is to use template files, the so called \"source descriptions\". Ready to use \
examples for Assembler, C, C++, E, Oberon and Modula-2 are distributed, additionally an example \
for supporting catalogs on Workbench 2.0. Any other examples are welcome."
