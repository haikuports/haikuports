SUMMARY="Standalone version of the hex dump utility that comes with ViM"
DESCRIPTION="xxd is a utility that comes with ViM. It can be used to view binary or text files as \
hex codes. It is often installed on UNIX-like systems. It can dump files to hex, and also do the \
same thing in reverse: recreate files from hex codes.

tinyxxd is a standalone fork of xxd, a slight modernization of the C code, a slight performance \
increase and a drop-in replacement for xxd. It contains the same logic and supports the exact \
same flags."
