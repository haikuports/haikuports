SUMMARY="A small build system similar to make"
DESCRIPTION="Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs \
from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its \
input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to \
run builds as fast as possible.
Ninja's low-level approach makes it perfect for embedding into more featureful \
build systems. Via gyp it can build Chrome and v8 and node.js etc.; via CMake \
it can build LLVM, KDE, Blender, etc."
