SUMMARY="The GNU debugger for embedded ARM"
DESCRIPTION="
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on \`inside' \
another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the \
moment it crashed.

GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) \
to help you catch bugs in the act:
 * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
 * Make your program stop on specified conditions.
 * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
 * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the \
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

The program being debugged can be written in Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal \
(and many other languages). Those programs might be executing on the same \
machine as GDB (native) or on another machine (remote). GDB can run on most \
popular UNIX and Microsoft Windows variants."
