SUMMARY="Helper to manage workspaces composed of git repositories"
DESCRIPTION="gws is a KISS, bash, colorful helper to manage workspaces \
composed of git repositories.

If you are, like me, a Linux programmer/hacker/coder who uses heavily git, \
you certainly have a directory in your home folder named dev, workspace, code \
or something else that contains all the projects you are working on.

Since I use at least three different computers, one laptop, one at home and \
one at work, I like to have the same folder structure on all of them. Of \
course remembering which project was added recently on others computer and in \
which folder is tedious.

So I started to thing about using git submodules to register all projects on \
which I am working and syncing them with git between the two computers. But \
clearly git submodules are not usable because they are working on specific \
commit and are not following branches.

No worry. The problem is pretty trivial, so I decided to start write a little \
bash (YOLO) script that read a simple list of repositories, and clone them if \
they don't exist. And then, commit by commit, the script as grown to finally \
become a helper to sync, monitor and check workspaces.

I thought it can be useful to other people, so I made a little cleanup, write \
a small documentation, and there it is. I hope you will enjoy it!"
