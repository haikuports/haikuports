SUMMARY="Python-based continuous integration testing framework"
DESCRIPTION="Buildbot is a continuous integration system designed to automate \
the build/test cycle. By automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each \
time something has changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly, before \
other developers are inconvenienced by the failure.
The main features are:

- Buildbot is easy to set up, but very extensible and customizable.  It \
supports arbitrary build processes, and is not limited to common build \
processes for particular languages (e.g., autotools or ant)
- Buildbot supports building and testing on a variety of platforms. \
Developers, who do not have the facilities to test their changes everywhere \
before committing, will know shortly afterwards whether they have broken the \
build or not.
- Buildbot has minimal requirements for slaves: using virtualenv, only a \
Python installation is required.
- Slaves can be run behind a NAT firewall and communicate with the master.
- Buildbot has a variety of status-reporting tools to get information about \
builds in front of developers in a timely manner.

This package contains the slave implementation, i.e. the part that is \
executing builds and/or tests."
