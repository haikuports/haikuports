SUMMARY="Python-based continuous integration testing framework."
DESCRIPTION="
Buildbot is a continuous integration system designed to automate the \
build/test cycle. By automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each time \
something has changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly, before other \
developers are inconvenienced by the failure.  Features

* Buildbot is easy to set up, but very extensible and customizable.  It \
  supports arbitrary build processes, and is not limited to common build \
  processes for particular languages (e.g., autotools or ant)

* Buildbot supports building and testing on a variety of platforms. \
  Developers, who do not have the facilities to test their changes everywhere \
  before committing, will know shortly afterwards whether they have broken the \
  build or not.

* Buildbot has minimal requirements for slaves: using virtualenv, only a \
  Python installation is required.

* Slaves can be run behind a NAT firewall and communicate with the master

* Buildbot has a variety of status-reporting tools to get information about \
  builds in front of developers in a timely manner. 

This package contains the slave implementation, i.e. the part that is \
executing builds and/or tests.
