SUMMARY="A testing framework for infrastructure software"
DESCRIPTION="Kyua is a testing framework for infrastructure software, \
originally designed to equip BSD-based operating systems with a test suite. \
This means that Kyua is lightweight and simple, and that Kyua integrates well \
with various build systems and continuous integration frameworks.

Kyua features an expressive test suite definition language, a safe runtime \
engine for test suites and a powerful report generation engine.

Kyua is for both developers and users, from the developer applying a simple \
fix to a library to the system administrator deploying a new release on a \
production machine.

Kyua is able to execute test programs written with a plethora of testing \
libraries and languages. The library of choice is ATF, for which Kyua was \
originally designed, but simple, framework-less test programs and \
TAP-compliant test programs can also be executed through Kyua."
