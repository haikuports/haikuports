SUMMARY="A C Markdown parser"
DESCRIPTION="MD4C is Markdown parser implementation in C, with the following features:
* Compliance: Generally, MD4C aims to be compliant to the latest version of CommonMark specification. Currently, we are fully compliant to CommonMark 0.30.
* Extensions: MD4C supports some commonly requested and accepted extensions.
* Performance: MD4C is very fast.
* Compactness: MD4C parser is implemented in one source file and one header file. There are no dependencies other than standard C library.
* Embedding: MD4C parser is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is very straightforward: There is actually just one function, md_parse().
* Push model: MD4C parses the complete document and calls few callback functions provided by the application to inform it about a start/end of every block, a start/end of every span, and with any textual contents.
* Portability: MD4C builds and works on Windows and POSIX-compliant OSes.
* Encoding: MD4C by default expects UTF-8 encoding of the input document.
* Permissive license: MD4C is available under the MIT license.
