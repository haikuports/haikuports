SUMMARY="I/O abstraction for reading/writing compound files"
DESCRIPTION="GSF was written as part of the Gnumeric project. It started in \
2002 as a replacement for libole2 which Gnumeric was using to handle the \
Microsoft ExcelÂ® file format, as libole2's code had become difficult to \
maintain and was difficult to generalize. GSF was designed to be a more \
general library for dealing with a number of different types of structured \
data files and streams.

With the release of Gnumeric 1.1.6 (July 2002), Gnumeric used GSF and libole2 \
was orphaned."
