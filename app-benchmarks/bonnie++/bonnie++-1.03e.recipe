SUMMARY="A benchmark and test suite for filesystems"
DESCRIPTION="
Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at performing a number of simple \
tests of hard drive and file system performance. Then you can decide which \
test is important and decide how to compare different systems after running \
it. I have no plans to ever have it produce a single number, because I don't \
think that a single number can be useful when comparing such things.
The main program tests database type access to a single file (or a set of \
files if you wish to test more than 1G of storage), and it tests creation, \
reading, and deleting of small files which can simulate the usage of programs \
such as Squid, INN, or Maildir format email.
The ZCAV program which I initially released as a seperate package tests the \
performance of different zones of a hard drive. It does not write any data (so \
you can use it on full file systems). It can show why comparing the speed of \
Windows at the start of a hard drive to Linux at the end of the hard drive \
(typical dual-boot scenario) isn't a valid comparison."
