SUMMARY="Test program for terminal emulators"
DESCRIPTION="Vttest tests the compatibility (demonstrates the non-compatibility) \
of so-called \"VT100-compatible\" terminals. In conformance of the good old \
hacker traditions, the only documentation of this program is the source code \
itself. To understand it, you also need a copy of the original VT100 manual \
from DEC.

Additional tests (past version 1.7) are provided for analysis of vt220, vt420 \
terminals, as well as variants of xterm."
