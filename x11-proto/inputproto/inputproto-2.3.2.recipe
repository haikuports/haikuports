SUMMARY="The X11 input extension protocol"
DESCRIPTION="XI2's intent is to replace both core input processing and prior \
versions of the X Input Extension. Historically, the majority of applications \
employed the core protocol requests and events to handle user input. The core \
protocol does not provide information about which device generated the event.

The X Input Extension version up to 1.5 requires the differentiation between \
core and extended devices. Extended devices may not be core devices and thus \
cannot be used on applications employing the core protocol. XI2 addresses both \
of these issues by enabling devices to be both extended and core devices and \
providing device information in each event (with the exception of core events)."
