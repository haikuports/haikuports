SUMMARY="Portable linker for multiple file formats"
DESCRIPTION="vlink is a portable linker, written in ANSI-C, that can read and \
write a wide range of object- and executable file formats. It can be used to \
link a specific target format from several different input file formats, or \
for converting, stripping and manipulating files.

The linker can be controlled by GNU-style linker scripts to generate absolute \
code, but it also runs very well with default rules to create relocatable \
executables, as required for AmigaOS or MorphOS.

Of course there might be technical restrictions that object files of different \
architectures cannot be merged because of incompatible relocation types, \
differing endianess or symbol-names with and without leading underscores. But \
in theory everything is possible!

Currently the following object and executable file formats are supported by vlink:
* ELF 32bit PowerPC big endian
* ELF 32bit PowerPC AmigaOS (special dynamic linking rules)
* ELF 32bit PowerPC MorphOS (relocatable executables)
* ELF 32bit PowerPC PowerUp (relocatable executables)
* ELF 32bit M68k big endian
* ELF 32bit x86 little endian
* ELF 32bit x86 AROS (relocatable executables)
* ELF 32bit ARM little endian
* ELF 64bit x86_64 little endian
* a.out Sun/010 (also Amiga/Atari 68000)
* a.out Sun/020 (also Amiga/Atari 68020+)
* a.out MiNT (embedded in Atari TOS format)
* a.out Jaguar (M68k with support for RISC relocations)
* a.out NetBSD/68k (4k and 8k pages)
* a.out NetBSD/386
* a.out PC/386
* a.out generic
* AmigaOS hunk format
* EHF, extended hunk format (WarpOS)
* Atari TOS format (writing only)
* Motorola S-Records (writing only)
* Intel-hex format (writing only)
* AMSDOS format (Amstrad/Schneider CPC)
* Commodore 8-bit PRG format
* Raw binaries (writing only)
* VOBJ, proprietary versatile object format (reading only)"
