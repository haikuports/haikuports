SUMMARY="The NASM assembler with seglef patches"
DESCRIPTION="The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler \
designed for portability and modularity. It supports a range of object file \
formats, including Linux and *BSD a.out, ELF, COFF, Mach-O, Microsoft 16-bit \
OBJ, Win32 and Win64. It will also output plain binary files. Its syntax is \
designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less \
complex. It supports all currently known x86 architectural extensions, and \
has strong support for macros."
