SUMMARY="Programming language designed for technical computing"
DESCRIPTION="Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming \
language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of \
other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, \
distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive \
mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, \
also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear \
algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. \
In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of \
external packages through Julia’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace."
