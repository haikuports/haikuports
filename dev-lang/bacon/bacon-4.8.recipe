SUMMARY="Basic to C converter"
DESCRIPTION="The name 'BaCon' is an acronym for 'Basic Converter'. \
It is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems, which \
runs on most Unix/Linux/BSD platforms, including MacOSX. It intends \
to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be compiled on \
different platforms (both 32bit and 64bit), while trying to revive \
the days of the good old BASIC."
