SUMMARY="The flat assembler"
DESCRIPTION="The flat assembler is a fast and efficient self-assembling x86 \
assembler for DOS, Windows Linux and Unix operating systems. \
Currently it supports x86 and x86-64 instructions sets with \
MMX, 3DNow!, SSE up to SSE4, AVX, AVX2 and XOP extensions, \
can produce output in plain binary, MZ, PE, COFF or ELF format. \
It includes the powerful but easy to use macroinstruction \
support and does multiple passes to optimize the instruction \
codes for size. The flat assembler is self-compilable and the \
complete source code is included."
