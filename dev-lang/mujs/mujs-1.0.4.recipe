SUMMARY="A lightweight Javascript interpreter"
DESCRIPTION="MuJS is a lightweight Javascript interpreter designed for \
embedding in other software to extend them with scripting capabilities.
MuJS was designed with a focus on small size, correctness, and simplicity. It \
is written in portable C and implements ECMAScript as specified by ECMA-262. \
The interface for binding with native code is designed to be as simple as \
possible to use, and is very similar to Lua. There is no need to interact \
with byzantine C++ template mechanisms, or worry about marking and unmarking \
garbage collection roots, or wrestle with obscure build systems."
