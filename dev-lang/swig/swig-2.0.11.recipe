SUMMARY="Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator"
DESCRIPTION="
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and \
C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with \
different types of target languages including common scripting languages such \
as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also \
includes non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, \
CFFI, UFFI), D, Go language, Java including Android, Lua, Modula-3, OCAML, \
Octave and R. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations \
(Guile, MzScheme/Racket, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to \
create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user \
interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is \
typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required \
for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also \
export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG is free \
software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial \
and non-commercial projects.
