SUMMARY="Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator"
DESCRIPTION="SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs \
written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG \
is used with different types of target languages including common scripting \
languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported \
languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp \
(CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI), D, Go language, Java including Android, \
Lua, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave and R. Also several interpreted and compiled \
Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket, Chicken) are supported. SWIG \
is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled \
programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and \
prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces \
and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call \
into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML \
and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG \
generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects."
