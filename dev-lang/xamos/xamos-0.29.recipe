SUMMARY="Cross-platform AMOS BASIC reimplementation"
DESCRIPTION="
This project is a complete re-write of jAMOS in C++ using SDL libraries and
(optional) Boost headers.

This initial release is run-only and does not feature an editor at this stage.
However, it is compatible with almost all programs created with the latest
jAMOS editor. All jAMOS examples (without AMAL) are running in XAMOS, often
with a serious speed boost over the Java original, particularly on low-end
platforms.
