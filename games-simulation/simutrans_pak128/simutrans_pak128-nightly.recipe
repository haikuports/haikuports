SUMMARY="Pakset for Simutrans"
DESCRIPTION="A 'pakset' is the data set that Simutrans needs to run: \
it contains all the data for the graphics of individual items (vehicles, \
roads, railways, buildings, etc.) and all of the balancing information \
(such as prices, speeds, capacities and so forth) necessary to make \
the game complete.
When Simutrans could only support 64px size graphics, pak128 already \
started. First pak to feature a complex economy and have a very wide \
variety of objects. It contains roughly 7 time more graphics data than \
pak64 and thus requires by far the largest amount of RAM and \
processing power of all Simutrans sets.
Nightly builds are versions only for debugging and testing. They may contain \
changes which make your savegames unreadable by any official version, or \
bugs that will destroy your game, or not even run. They are for bug testing \
only."
