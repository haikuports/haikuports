SUMMARY="A game to relive the 1960s Space Race"
DESCRIPTION="Race Into Space is a simulation of the US-Soviet Space Race. \
In it, you take charge of your country’s space program as Director (US) or \
Designer (USSR). You will purchase and develop space hardware, recruit and \
manage astronauts/cosmonauts, and plan and send missions into space. \
The ultimate goal is to be the first to complete a Moon landing and return \
your people safely to Earth.

Race Into Space (RIS) is a port to modern operating systems of Buzz Aldrin’s \
Race Into Space (BARIS), a DOS game originally released in 1993 on floppy \
disk, and a year later in an expanded CD version. BARIS was developed by \
Fritz Bronner based on his 1989 board game Liftoff!. Dr. Aldrin’s name and \
imagery have been dropped because permission to use them was limited to the \
old DOS game."
