SUMMARY="Free 3D city simulator"
DESCRIPTION="Once upon the time, I was travelling over the Internet, and I \
found a city simulator under linux called FreeReign at SourceForge. But it \
isn't maintained any more. I decided to push the game up so I had a look at \
the FreeReign sources. However, its codes were not obvious to me, and in \
addition the game design didn't fit my programming style. Finally, I decided \
to write my own free 3D city simulator, based on the original ideas of the \
FreeReign project. Few months later, OpenCity was born.

OpenCity is a full 3D city simulator game project. It is written in standard \
C++ with OpenGL and SDL from scratch. It is not intended to be a clone of any \
famous city simulator from Max*s. So, if you are looking to download a free \
SimCity 4 like, please forget OpenCity. I work on it at my spare time, and I \
really meant it \"my spare time\" !

OpenCity is also an OpenGL/SDL/C++ game programming tutorial. In the \
resources section, you can find the micro simulators' algorithm, design \
document, UML diagram and information about other issues. The UML diagram is \
edited with Umbrello, the free UML diagram editor for KDE."
