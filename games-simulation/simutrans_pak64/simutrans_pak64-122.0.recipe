SUMMARY="Pakset for Simutrans"
DESCRIPTION="A 'pakset' is the data set that Simutrans needs to run: \
it contains all the data for the graphics of individual items (vehicles, \
roads, railways, buildings, etc.) and all of the balancing information \
(such as prices, speeds, capacities and so forth) necessary to make \
the game complete.
Pak64 is the main and a base set for Simutrans developed along with \
Simutrans executable. It always contains the most recent features. It is \
neatly painted pixel by pixel with motherly care. On the other hand it \
might look too tiny on high resolution displays. Many artists contributed \
to this pak set, from the 8 bit age on."
