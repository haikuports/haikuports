SUMMARY="Amiga music file player for UNIX"
DESCRIPTION="UADE plays old Amiga tunes through UAE emulation and cloned \
m68k-assembler Eagleplayer API.

UADE is Open Source compatible with  Free Software definition. UADE is \
licensed with GNU GPL. This software would not have been possible for us to \
produce without the great Free Software model which allowed us to make use of \
years of hard work of the UAE team. Most of the thanks goes to their \
pioneering work to build the necessary infrastructure, especially Bernd \
Schmidt, the initiator of UAE project.

The player infrastructure of UADE is built on the ground work of Eagleplayer \
and Delitracker projects. We want to mention few people from both projects. \
Jan Blumenthal and Henryk Richter from the Eagleplayer project; Peter Kunath, \
Frank Riffel and Florian Vorberger from Delitracker project; Those projects \
formed an infrastructure on which many different people produced reusable \
external players, thanks to them too. UADE makes these external players \
reusable on certain UNIX and other platforms.

UADE contains a free (as in freedom) implementation of Eagleplayer and \
Delitracker API for UNIX variants such as GNU/Linux (Alpha, AMD64 (x86-64), \
PA-RISC, PPC, Playstation2 and x86), Free/OpenBSD (x86), Solaris (sparc), \
Digital Alpha UNIX, IRIX (mips), Mac OS X (ppc), and for other OS variants \
such as AmigaOS/MorphOS. It is designed to be run as an XMMS, with \
Cjukebox/Musicus, or a Audacious media player input plugin A built-in cmdline \
interface also exists."
