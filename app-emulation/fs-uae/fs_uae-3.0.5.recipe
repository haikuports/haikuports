SUMMARY="FS-UAE is a cross platform Amiga emulator ported from WinUAE"
DESCRIPTION="Accurate Amiga Emulation

FS-UAE integrates the most accurate Amiga emulation code available from \
WinUAE. FS-UAE emulates A500, A500+, A600, A1200, A1000, A3000 and A4000 \
models, but you can tweak the hardware configuration and create customized \
Amigas.

On-Screen GUI With Gamepad Control

FS-UAE is fully controllable with a gamepad - you can easily swap floppies \
and load save states through the on-screen GUI. In addition to being great \
on your personal computer, FS-UAE is also well suited to be started from an \
emulator frontend running on a HTPC.

Emulate High-End Amigas

FS-UAE supports emulating an Amiga 4000 with an CPU as fast as your \
system can emulate it. Picasso96 drivers can be used with the built-in \
UAEgfx card to display Workbench in high resolutions and with up to 16.7 \
million colors, and the built-in bsdsocket.library means that the Amiga \
will have access to the Internet.

Community Support

There is a support forum for FS-UAE on the English Amiga Board with many \
active registered users. If you are stuck, you'll almost certainly get an \
answer to your questions there. You can also leave comments on fs-uae.net \
is you rather want that.

Online Documentation

A great deal of documentation about how to use and configure FS-UAE is \
available on fs-uae.net."
