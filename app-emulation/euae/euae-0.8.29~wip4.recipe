SUMMARY="E-UAE Experimental Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator"
DESCRIPTION="This is a version of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an \
emulation core largely based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the \
great features of WinUAE to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally \
has a name, E-UAE, since that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' \
can stand for anything you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, \
egalitarian, eggplant, . . .
Currently it will build and run (with a varying degree of supported features) \
on Linux and other Unices, Mac OS X, BeOS, AmigaOS itself (either for 68k \
machines or PPC machines with AmigaOS 4.0 and the AmigaOS clones MorphOS and \
AROS). OS X requires either LibSDL or an X server for graphics output, but \
native graphics are supported on AmigaOS and BeOS, although, at the moment, \
SDL is also preferred on BeOS since the native driver is incomplete.
E-UAE is open-source software and is made available under the terms of the \
GNU GPL. E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd \
Schmidt (the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the author \
of the x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of WinUAE), and \
many more.
To make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image of some version of \
the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which may \
work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted material \
and may not be freely distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If you don't \
have an Amiga from which you can legally make a ROM image, a selection of ROM \
images are available for purchase online from Cloanto - publishers of the \
Amiga Forever distribution."
