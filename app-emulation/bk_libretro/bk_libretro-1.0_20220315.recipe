SUMMARY="A Soviet Electronica BK computers emulator core for libretro"
DESCRIPTION="This core emulates the Soviet Electronica BK computers series, \
including the BK-0010, BK-0010.01 and BK-0011(M), as well as the Terak \
8510/a, which is a 1976 American PDP-11/03 platform that the Electronica BK \
series were designed after. The BK series computers were the first \
mass-produced, affordable personal computers in Russia in the 1980s and they \
had a tremendous effect on the development of the Russian-speaking software \
community, similar to the C64, ZX Spectrum and Atari 2600 communities \
elsewhere in the world. These computers will accept console commands in \
English but respond mostly in Russian, so this core is mostly of use to \
Russian-speaking users."
