SUMMARY="A tool to go the way from the VideoCD (VCD) to the MPEG file"
DESCRIPTION="Since BeOS is supposed to be the multimedia operating system, \
it also should be able to deal with hardcopies of media files. \
In our case these are VideoCD's, containing one or more MPEG-1 \
video files on a CD-ROM (XA) as laid down in the white book \
of compact disc standards. Since BeOS already has the media \
player supplied that is capable of playing MPEG streams, we \
needed a tool to go the way from the VideoCD (VCD) to the MPEG \
file on our harddisk. This can be done by this tool, called \
VCDGear, originally coded by Dracore (dracore@home.com), and \
ported to BeOS R5 by myself, Be-NiB (be-nib@web.de)."
