SUMMARY="A native code to C/C++ decompiler"
DESCRIPTION="Snowman is a native code to C/C++ decompiler, \
supporting x86, AMD64, and ARM architectures. You can use it \
as a standalone GUI application, command-line tool, IDA plug-in \
or a library. Snowman is free software.\
* Supports ARM, x86, and x86-64 architectures.
* Reads ELF, Mach-O, and PE file formats
* Reconstructs functions, their names and arguments, local and global variables,
expressions, integer, pointer and structural types, all types of control-flow
structures, including switch.
* Has a nice graphical user interface with one-click navigation between the
assembler code and the reconstructed program.
* Has a command-line interface for batch processing."
