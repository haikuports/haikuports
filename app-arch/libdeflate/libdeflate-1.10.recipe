SUMMARY="A library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based (de)compression"
DESCRIPTION="libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and \
decompression.

The supported formats are:
- DEFLATE (raw)
- zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
- gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)

libdeflate is heavily optimized.  It is significantly faster than the zlib library, both for \
compression and decompression, and especially on x86 processors.
In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes that provide a better \
compression ratio than the zlib's level 9."
