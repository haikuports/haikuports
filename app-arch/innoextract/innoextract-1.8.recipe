SUMMARY="A tool to unpack installers created by Inno Setup"
DESCRIPTION="Inno Setup is a tool to create installers for Microsoft Windows \
applications. innoextract allows to extract such installers under non-Windows \
systems without running the actual installer using wine. innoextract currently\
 supports installers created by Inno Setup 1.2.10 to 5.6.0.
In addition to standard Inno Setup installers, innoextract also supports some \
modified Inno Setup variants including Martijn Laan's My Inno Setup Extensions\
 3.0.6.1 as well as GOG.com's Inno Setup-based game installers."
