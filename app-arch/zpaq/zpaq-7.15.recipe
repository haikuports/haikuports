SUMMARY="Incremental journaling archiver with powerful compression"
DESCRIPTION="zpaq is a free and open source incremental, \
journaling command-line archiver. Among its features include \
up to four billion files and 250 terabytes of data before compression,\
encrypted archives via AES, multi-part/split archives,\
and powerful compression through multiple methods.\
\
zpaq is only intended for user-level backups. It should not be used to \
archive the operating system, as it does not follow links or save special \
files such as devices, sockets, or pipes."
