SUMMARY="Saves and restores files to/from a tape or disk archive"
DESCRIPTION="The Tar program provides the ability to create tar archives, as \
well as various other kinds of manipulation. For example, you can use Tar on \
previously created archives to extract files, to store additional files, or \
to update or list files which were already stored.

Initially, tar archives were used to store files conveniently on magnetic \
tape. The name \"Tar\" comes from this use; it stands for tape archiver. Despite \
the utility's name, Tar can direct its output to available devices, files, or \
other programs (using pipes), it can even access remote devices or files (as \
archives)."
