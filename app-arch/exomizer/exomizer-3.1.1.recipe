SUMMARY="8-bit CPU oriented compression tools"
DESCRIPTION="Exomizer is a program that compresses files in a way that tries \
to be as efficient as possible but still allows them to be decompressed in \
environments where CPU speed and RAM are limited. For some popular 8-bit \
computers using 6502 compatible CPUs it can also generate executable files \
that decompress themselves in memory when run.

The exomizer program itself is a console application written in ANSI-C.

Exomizer operates in two major modes. It has a raw mode that compresses plain \
files and produces plain files. This mode is used by the raw subcommand. All \
other subcommands use the second mode. It requires all source files to be \
targeted to be decrunched at specific addresses in the 16-bit address space \
of the target computer. In this mode, no file can be larger than 64kB since \
all data must be addressable using 16-bits. The targeted mode has the \
following features:
* It reads plain or .prg files to any given address.
* It can produce stand-alone self-decrunching files for the following targets:
  * Commodore VIC20, C64, C16/plus4 and C128
  * Atari 400/800 XL/XE
  * Apple ][+ and //e
  * Oric-1 and Oric Atmos
* It can produce files for both \"in memory\" and \"from disk\" decrunching.
* It handles RLE-sequences well, no packer is necessary.
* It is able to link/combine more than one source file into the same crunched target file."
