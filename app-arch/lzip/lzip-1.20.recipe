SUMMARY="Lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm"
DESCRIPTION="Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface \
similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip is about as fast as gzip, \
compresses most files more than bzip2, and is better than both \
from a data recovery perspective. Lzip is a clean implementation \
of the LZMA \"algorithm\".

The lzip file format is designed for data sharing and long-term \
archiving, taking into account both data integrity and decoder \
availability:

- The lzip format provides very safe integrity checking and some \
data recovery means. The lziprecover program can repair bit-flip \
errors (one of the most common forms of data corruption) in lzip \
files, and provides data recovery capabilities, including \
error-checked merging of damaged copies of a file.
- The lzip format is as simple as possible (but not simpler). \
The lzip manual provides the code of a simple decompressor along \
with a detailed explanation of how it works, so that with the only \
help of the lzip manual it would be possible for a digital \
archaeologist to extract the data from a lzip file long after \
quantum computers eventually render LZMA obsolete.
- Additionally the lzip reference implementation is copylefted, \
which guarantees that it will remain free forever."
