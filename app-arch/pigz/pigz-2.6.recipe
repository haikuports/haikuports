SUMMARY="A parallel implementation of gzip for multi-processor machines"
DESCRIPTION="
pigz, which stands for Parallel Implementation of GZip, is a fully functional \
replacement for gzip that exploits multiple processors and multiple cores to \
the hilt when compressing data.

pigz was written by Mark Adler, and uses the zlib and pthread libraries.

This version of pigz is written to be portable across Unix-style operating \
systems that provide the zlib and pthread libraries."
