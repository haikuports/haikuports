SUMMARY="A script for managing file archives"
DESCRIPTION="The main command is aunpack which extracts files from an archive. \
Did you ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the \
files were located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, \
resulting in files scattered all over the place? aunpack overcomes this problem \
by first extracting to a new directory. If there was only a single file in the archive, \
that file is moved to the original directory. aunpack also prevents local files from \
being overwritten by mistake.

The other commands provided are apack (to create archives), als (to list files in \
archives), and acat (to extract files to standard out). As atool invokes external \
programs to handle the archives, not all commands may be supported for a \
certain type of archives.

atool identifies archives by their file extension. Sometimes this is not possible \
- for instance rar archives usually have varying numeric file extensions. In those \
cases when atool can't identify the format, file is used instead. (atool can be \
configured not to use file.)"
