SUMMARY="Mouse and Keyboard sharing software"
DESCRIPTION="Most people think of their computers as single, isolated units. \
Our mission is to change that so people think of all their computers as \
a single seamless system.

Synergy brings your computers together in one cohesive experience; its free \
and open source cross-platform software for sharing one mouse and keyboard \
between multiple computers on your desk. It works on Windows, Mac OS X and \
Linux allowing you to seamlessly move your mouse cursor between computers."
