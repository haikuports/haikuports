SUMMARY="A free, open-source file pager"
DESCRIPTION="GNU 'less' is a program similar to 'more', but which allows \
backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, 'less' \
does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with \
large input files it starts up faster than text editors like 'vi'.
Less uses 'termcap' (or 'terminfo' on some systems), so it can run on a \
variety of terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals."
