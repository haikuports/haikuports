SUMMARY="A pattern scanning and processing language"
DESCRIPTION="
If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to make \
changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, or \
extract data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest. To \
write a program to do this in a language such as C or Pascal is a \
time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code. The job \
is easy with awk.

The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that \
makes it possible to handle simple data-reformatting jobs with just a \
few lines of code."
