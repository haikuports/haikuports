SUMMARY="A utility for EZ-USB firmware installation"
DESCRIPTION="This program is conveniently able to download firmware into FX, \
FX2, and FX2LP EZ-USB devices, as well as the original AnchorChips EZ-USB.
Primarily as an aid for developers, this can also be used to update firmware \
on devices which boot from I2C serial EEPROMs.  For that use, as well as \
downloading firmware to all other off-chip memory, a second stage loader must \
first be downloaded.

The distribution includes a3load.hex, which is a simple second stage loader \
that works with all the EZ-USB products listed above.  If you want to write to \
an EEPROM, you can use the appropriate version of the Vend_Ax code provided \
with the Cypress developer kit.

This program was modified from the original version available from \
http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net to use libusbx [http://libusbx.org]. The \
aim is to integrate this program into the libusbx samples directory.
Besides Linux, use of libusbx as the USB backend allows fxload to be used on \
Windows, OS-X as well as any other platform supported by libusbx.
You are invited to post any bug reports or patches to the libusbx-devel \
mailing list."
