SUMMARY="A code-searching tool similar to ack, but faster"
DESCRIPTION="A tool for searching code. It started off as a clone of Ack, but their \
feature sets have since diverged slightly.
* It searches code about 3–5× faster than ack.
* It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
* If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add \
their patterns to a .agignore file.
* Ag uses Pthreads to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and search files in \
parallel."
