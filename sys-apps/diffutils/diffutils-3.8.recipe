SUMMARY="Several programs for finding differences between files"
DESCRIPTION="You can use the diff command to show differences between two \
files, or each corresponding file in two directories. diff outputs \
differences between files line by line in any of several formats, selectable \
by command line options. This set of differences is often called a 'diff' or \
'patch'.
You can use the cmp command to show the offsets and line numbers where two \
files differ. cmp can also show all the characters that differ between the two \
files, side by side.
You can use the diff3 command to show differences among three files. When two \
people have made independent changes to a common original, diff3 can report \
the differences between the original and the two changed versions, and can \
produce a merged file that contains both persons' changes together with \
warnings about conflicts.
You can use the sdiff command to merge two files interactively."
