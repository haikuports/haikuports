SUMMARY="A pattern scanning and processing language"
DESCRIPTION="
	If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to make
	changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, or
	extract data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest. To
	write a program to do this in a language such as C or Pascal is a
	time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code. The job
	is easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: gawk.

	The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that
	makes it possible to handle simple data-reformatting jobs with just a
	few lines of code.
