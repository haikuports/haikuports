-*A minimal, fast alternative to `du -sh`.*
+*A minimal, fast alternative to `du -sb`.*
 
 `diskus` is a very simple program that computes the total size of the current directory. It is a
-parallelized version of `du -sh`. On my 8-core laptop, it is about ten times faster than `du` with
+parallelized version of `du -sb`. On my 8-core laptop, it is about ten times faster than `du` with
 a cold disk cache and more than three times faster with a warm disk cache.
