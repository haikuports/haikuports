SUMMARY="The famous stream editor"
DESCRIPTION="Sed is a stream editor, i.e. it can be used to perform basic \
text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as \
ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently \
more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which \
particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors."
