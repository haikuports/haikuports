SUMMARY="Advanced command line tool like standard 'diff'"
DESCRIPTION="spiff is a command line program that compares the contents of \
two files and prints a description of the important differences between them \
in a form rather like the standard 'diff' utility.  However, unlike diff, it \
is not line oriented -- it compares word sequences with all white space and \
newlines disregarded, so even if formatting is different you only see the \
significant differences.  It also compares floating-point values with a \
tolerance, so you can look in data files for discrepancies."
