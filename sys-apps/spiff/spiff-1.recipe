SUMMARY="Advanced command line tool like standard 'diff'"
DESCRIPTION="
'spiff' is a command line program that compares the contents of two files and \
prints a description of the important differences between them in a form \
rather like the standard 'diff' utility.  However, unlike diff, it is not line \
oriented -- it compares word sequences with all white space and newlines \
disregarded, so even if formatting is different you only see the significant \
differences.  It also compares floating-point values with a tolerance, so you \
can look in data files for discrepancies."
