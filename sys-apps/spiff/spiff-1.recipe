DESCRIPTION="
	'spiff' is a command line program that compares the contents of two files
	and prints a description of the important differences between them in a
	form rather like the standard 'diff' utility.  However, unlike diff, it is
	not line oriented -- it compares word sequences with all white space and
	newlines disregarded, so even if formatting is different you only see the
	significant differences.  It also compares floating-point values with a
	tolerance, so you can look in data files for discrepancies."	
SUMMARY="Advanced command line tool like standard 'diff'"
