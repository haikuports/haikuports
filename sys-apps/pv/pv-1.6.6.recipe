SUMMARY="A terminal-based tool for monitoring \
the progress of data through a pipeline"
DESCRIPTION="pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring \
the progress of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any \
normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how \
quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to \
completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion. \
Additional support is available for multiple instances working in tandem, \
to given a visual indicator of relative throughput in a complex pipeline."
