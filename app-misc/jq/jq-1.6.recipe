SUMMARY="A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor"
DESCRIPTION="jq is like sed for JSON data – you can use it to slice \
and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease \
that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text. \
It is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime dependencies. \
You can download a single binary, scp it to a far away machine, \
and expect it to work. It can mangle the data format that you have into \
the one that you want with very little effort, and the program to do so \
is often shorter and simpler than you’d expect."
