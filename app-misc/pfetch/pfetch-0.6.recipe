SUMMARY="A pretty system information tool written in POSIX sh"
DESCRIPTION="The goal of this project is to implement a simple system \
information tool in POSIX sh using features built into the language itself \
(*where possible*). The source code is highly documented and the author hopes \
it will act as a learning resource for POSIX sh and simple information \
detection across various different operating systems."
