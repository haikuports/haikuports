SUMMARY="A full-screen terminal window manager"
DESCRIPTION="Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a \
physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.

Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal \
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 \
(ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support \
for multiple character sets).

There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and \
a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions \
between windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window \
with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of \
your way so that you can use the program as you normally would.
Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with \
other programs in them (including more shells), kill the current window, \
view a list of the active windows, turn output logging on and off, copy \
text between windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows, \
etc.

All windows run their programs completely independent of each other. \
Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible \
and even when the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal. \
A command-line compatible rm which destroys file contents before unlinking."
