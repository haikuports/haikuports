SUMMARY="Print images onto your terminal"
DESCRIPTION="imgcat prints images to your terminal screen. Yes, indeed it does. \
By default, the image is printed at the full width and colour depth \
detected for your terminal. These can be overridden using -w to adjust \
the maximum width or -R to prevent resizing, even if the image is too \
big to fit in the terminal; and -d to explicitly the set color depth. \


If the output stream is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to \
a file, or piped into another program), then the image is not resized to \
the size of the terminal. It does, however, uses the color depth of terminal \
set in the TERM environment variable. Overriding both width and color \
depth still work.
