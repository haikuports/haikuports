SUMMARY="A library to access multiple forms of archives"
DESCRIPTION="Physfs is short for PhysicsFS. It's a C library that provides \
abstract access to various archives. It is intended for use in video games, \
and the design was somewhat inspired by Quake 3's file subsystem.

The programmer defines a \"write directory\" on the physical filesystem to \
which all writing through the PhysicsFS is restricted for security reasons.
PhysicsFS gives you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are \
available, the user's home directory (where in the real filesystem your \
game is running), etc."
