SUMMARY="Java-based build tool similar to 'make'"
DESCRIPTION="
Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive \
processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent \
upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java \
applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, \
assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be used effectively to \
build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More \
generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described \
in terms of targets and tasks.
Ant is written in Java. Users of Ant can develop their own "antlibs" \
containing Ant tasks and types, and are offered a large number of ready-made \
commercial or open-source "antlibs".
Ant is extremely flexible and does not impose coding conventions or directory \
layouts to the Java projects which adopt it as a build tool.
Software development projects looking for a solution combining build tool and \
dependency management can use Ant in combination with Apache Ivy.
The Apache Ant project is part of the Apache Software Foundation.
