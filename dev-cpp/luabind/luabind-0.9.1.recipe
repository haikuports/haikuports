SUMMARY="Create bindings between C++ and Lua"
DESCRIPTION="Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ \
and Lua. It has the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, \
to Lua. It will also supply the functionality to define classes in lua and let \
them derive from other lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override \
virtual functions from their C++ baseclasses. It is written towards Lua 5.x, \
and does not work with Lua 4.

It is implemented utilizing template meta programming. That means that you \
don't need an extra preprocess pass to compile your project (it is done by \
the compiler). It also means you don't (usually) have to know the exact \
signature of each function you register, since the library will generate code \
depending on the compile-time type of the function (which includes the \
signature). The main drawback of this approach is that the compilation time \
will increase for the file that does the registration, it is therefore \
recommended that you register everything in the same cpp-file."
