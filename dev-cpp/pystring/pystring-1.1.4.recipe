SUMMARY="C++ functions matching the interface and behavior of python string methods"
DESCRIPTION="Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the \
interface and behavior of python's string class methods using std::string.
Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter. \
It provides convenience and familiarity for common string operations not \
included in the standard C++ library. It's also useful in environments where \
both C++ and python are used.

Overlapping functionality (such as index and slice/substr) of std::string is \
included to match python interfaces.

Note: Despite the infrequent updates, this repo is not dead/abandoned - just \
stable!  We use it every day at Imageworks."
