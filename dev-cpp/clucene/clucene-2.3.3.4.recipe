SUMMARY="clucene the open-source, C++ search engine"
DESCRIPTION="CLucene is a high-performance, scalable, cross platform, \
full-featured, open-source indexing and searching API. Specifically, CLucene \
is the guts of a search engine, the hard stuff. You write the easy stuff: the \
UI and the process of selecting and parsing your data files to pump them into \
the search engine yourself, and any specialized queries to pull it back for \
display or further processing.

CLucene is a port of the very popular Java Lucene text search engine API. \
CLucene aims to be a good alternative to Java Lucene when performance really \
matters or if you want to stick to good old C++. CLucene is faster than Lucene \
as it is written in C++, meaning it is being compiled into machine code, has \
no background GC operations, and requires no any extra setup procedures.

Being written in pure cross-platform C++ code, and utilizing the flexible \
CMake build system, CLucene can virtually be used for any purpose, on any \
machine. From PCs running Windows or Linux to Mobile devices. The sky is the \
limit."
