SUMMARY="Experimental range library for C++11/14/17"
DESCRIPTION="Ranges are an extension of the Standard Template Library that \
makes its iterators and algorithms more powerful by making them composable. \
Unlike other range-like solutions which seek to do away with iterators, in \
range-v3 ranges are an abstration layer on top of iterators.

Range-v3 is built on three pillars: Views, Actions, and Algorithms. \
The algorithms are the same as those with which you are already familiar \
in the STL, except that in range-v3 all the algorithms have overloads that \
take ranges in addition to the overloads that take iterators. Views are \
composable adaptations of ranges where the adaptation happens lazily as the \
view is iterated. And an action is an eager application of an algorithm to a \
container that mutates the container in-place and returns it for further processing."
