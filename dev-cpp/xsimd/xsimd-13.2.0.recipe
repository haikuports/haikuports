SUMMARY="C++ wrappers for SIMD intrinsics"
DESCRIPTION="SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors that has \
been available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a single operation on a batch of values \
at once, and thus provide a way to significantly accelerate code execution. However, these \
instructions differ between microprocessor vendors and compilers.

xsimd provides a unified means for using these features for library authors. Namely, it enables \
manipulation of batches of numbers with the same arithmetic operators as for single values. It \
also provides accelerated implementation of common mathematical functions operating on batches."
