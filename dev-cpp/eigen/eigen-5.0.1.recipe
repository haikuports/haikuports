SUMMARY="A C++ template library for linear algebra, vectors and more"
DESCRIPTION="Eigen is a versatile, fast, elegant and reliable template library \
that supports all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily \
large dense matrices, and even sparse matrices.
- It supports all standard numeric types, including std::complex, integers, \
and is easily extensible to custom numeric types.
- It supports various matrix decompositions and geometry features.
- Its ecosystem of unsupported modules provides many specialized features \
such as non-linear optimization, matrix functions, a polynomial solver, FFT, \
and much more.
- Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable \
lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate.
- Explicit vectorization is performed for SSE 2/3/4, AVX, FMA, AVX512, \
ARM NEON (32-bit and 64-bit), PowerPC instruction sets, and now S390x SIMD \
(ZVector) with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code.
- Fixed-size matrices are fully optimized: dynamic memory allocation is \
avoided, and the loops are unrolled when that makes sense.
- For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness.
- Algorithms are carefully selected for reliability. Reliability trade-offs \
are clearly documented and extremely safe decompositions are available.
- Eigen is thoroughly tested through its own test suite (over 500 executables) \
the standard BLAS test suite, and parts of the LAPACK test suite.
- The API is extremely clean and expressive while feeling natural to C++ \
programmers, thanks to expression templates.
- Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying pseudocode."
