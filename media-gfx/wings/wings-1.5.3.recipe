SUMMARY="A 3D polygon modeler"
DESCRIPTION="Wings 3D is an advanced subdivision modeler that is both powerful \
and easy to use.

Originally inspired by Nendo and Mirai from Izware, Wings 3D has been \
developed since 2001, when Bj√∂rn Gustavsson (bjorng) and Dan Gudmundsson \
(dgud) first started the project. Richard Jones (optigon) maintained Wings and \
coded many new features between 2006 and 2011. Wings 3D is currently \
maintained by Dan and Richard with the help of the great community.

Wings 3D offers a wide range of modeling tools, a customizable interface, \
support for lights and materials, and a built-in AutoUV mapping facility.

There is no support in Wings for animation."
