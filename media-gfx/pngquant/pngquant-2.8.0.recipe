SUMMARY="A utility for lossy compression of PNG images"
DESCRIPTION="Pngquant converts 32-bit RGBA PNGs to 8-bit (or smaller) \
RGBA-palette PNGs, optionally using Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

The conversion reduces file sizes significantly (often as much as 70%) and \
preserves full alpha transparency. Generated images are compatible with all \
modern web browsers, and have better fallback in IE6 than 24-bit PNGs."
