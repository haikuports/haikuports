SUMMARY="Minimalist image viewer"
DESCRIPTION="qView was designed from the very start to be as visually minimal \
and space efficient as possible. No cluttered interface, just your image and a \
titlebar.
qView opens practically instantly, and switching images is just as quick, all \
while having low memory and CPU usage.
With features such as animated GIF controls, file history, rotation/mirroring, \
and multithreaded preloading, minimalism doesn't have to be a compromise."
