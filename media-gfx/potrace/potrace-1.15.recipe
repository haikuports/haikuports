SUMMARY="Utility for tracing a bitmap"
DESCRIPTION="Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a \
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM, \
PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector \
file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned \
data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. \
The resulting image is not \"jaggy\" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can \
then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS, \
PostScript, PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), DXF, GeoJSON, PGM \
(for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and \
XFig. Additional backends might be added in the future.

A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act \
as a pre-processor for Potrace, applying scaling and various filters \
to an image before converting it to a bitmap. This is useful for \
potracing greyscale and color images.
