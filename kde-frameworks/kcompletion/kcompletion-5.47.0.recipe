SUMMARY="Powerful completion framework"
DESCRIPTION="When typing filenames, email addresses and other text where the \
user often wants to select from existing data (including what they previously \
typed) rather than enter anything wholly original, users often find it \
helpful if they only need to type the first few characters, and then have the \
application offer them a set of choices or attempt to finish off what they \
were typing. Email clients, shells and \"open file\" dialogs often provide \
this functionality.

This framework helps implement this in Qt-based applications. You can use one \
of the completion-ready widgets provided by this framework, or integrate it \
into your application's other widgets directly."
