SUMMARY="Core components for the KDE Activity concept"
DESCRIPTION="When a user is interacting with a computer, there are three main \
areas of contextual information that may affect the behaviour of the system: \
who the user is, where they are, and what they are doing.

Activities deal with the last one. An activity might be \"developing a KDE \
application\", \"studying 19th century art\", \"composing music\" or \"watching \
funny videos\". Each of these activites may involve multiple applications, \
and a single application may be used in multiple activities (for example, \
most activities are likely to involve using a web browser, but different \
activities will probably involve different websites).

KActivities provides the infrastructure needed to manage a user's activites, \
allowing them to switch between tasks, and for applications to update their \
state to match the user's current activity. This includes a daemon, a library \
for interacting with that daemon, and plugins for integration with other \
frameworks."
