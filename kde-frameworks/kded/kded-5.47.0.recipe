SUMMARY="Central daemon of KDE work spaces"
DESCRIPTION="KDED stands for KDE Daemon which isn't very descriptive. KDED \
runs in the background and performs a number of small tasks. Some of these \
tasks are built in, others are started on demand.

Built in tasks

* Checking for newly installed software and updating ksycoca when new \
software is detected. Updating of ksycoca is done by the program \
kbuildsycoca which gets started by kded. When kded is first started it \
always runs kbuildsycoca to ensure that ksycoca is up to date.

* Checking for newly installed update files. Applications can install *.upd \
update files. These *.upd files are used to update configuration files of \
users, primarily when new versions of applications are installed with \
(slightly) different configuration file formats. Updating of configuration \
files is done by kconf_update. kded starts kconf_update when it detects a \
new update file. When kded is first started it always runs kconf_update to \
ensure that it has not missed any update files. kconf_update keeps track of \
which update files have been processed already in the config-file \
kconf_updaterc. It only performs a certain update once."
