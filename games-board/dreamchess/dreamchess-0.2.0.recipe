SUMMARY="XBoard-compatible 3D chess interface and engine"
DESCRIPTION="DreamChess is an open source chess game. Our primary target platforms are Windows, \
Mac OS X and Linux. DreamChess features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets, \
ranging from classic wooden to flat figurines.

A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this engine be too weak \
for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible chess engine, including the popular Crafty \
and GNU Chess.

Other features include music, sound effects, on-screen move lists using SAN notation, undo \
functionality, and savegames in PGN format.

The DreamChess team currently consists of only a handful of people. We could use help in many \
areas, such as programming, graphics, sound and testing. If you’re interested in helping out, \
please send an email to feedback at dreamchess.org."
