SUMMARY="An INI parser for Python"
DESCRIPTION="
iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:
* Compatiable with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations of \
ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that are \
API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass all the unit tests \
included with Python.
* Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options, indentation, \
comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as possible when data is updated.
* More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation \
(cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).
* It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by \
programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file \
completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also allows \
making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable \
in applications like image galleries."
