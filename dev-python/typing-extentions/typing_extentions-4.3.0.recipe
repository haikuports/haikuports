SUMMARY="Backported and experimental type hints for Python"
DESCRIPTION="The typing_extensions module serves two related purposes:

- Enable use of new type system features on older Python versions. For example,
  typing.TypeGuard is new in Python 3.10, but typing_extensions allows
  users on Python 3.6 through 3.9 to use it too.
- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and
  added to the typing module.

New features may be added to typing_extensions as soon as they are specified in a PEP that has \
been added to the python/peps repository. If the PEP is accepted, the feature will then be added \
to typing for the next CPython release. No typing PEP has been rejected so far, so we haven't yet \
figured out how to deal with that possibility.

Starting with version 4.0.0, typing_extensions uses Semantic Versioning. The major version is \
incremented for all backwards-incompatible changes. Therefore, it's safe to depend on \
typing_extensions like this: typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1), where x.y is the first version that \
includes all features you need.

typing_extensions supports Python versions 3.7 and higher. In the future, support for older \
Python versions will be dropped some time after that version reaches end of life."
