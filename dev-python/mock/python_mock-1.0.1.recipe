SUMMARY="A library for testing in Python"
DESCRIPTION="
Mock allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects \
and make assertions about how they have been used.

Mock provides a core 'MagicMock' class removing the need to create a host of \
stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an action, you can make \
assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were \
called with. You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in \
the normal way.

The mock module also provides utility functions / objects to assist with \
testing, particularly monkey patching.
