SUMMARY="Python library for iterating, searching, and modifying an HTML/XML parse tree"
DESCRIPTION="
	Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like \
	screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

	* Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, \
	searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and \
	extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write an application
	* Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing \
	documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless the document \
	doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't detect one. Then you just have \
	to specify the original encoding.
	* Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing \
	you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.

	Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree traversal stuff for you. \
	You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or \"Find all the links of class externalLink\", \
	or \"Find all the links whose urls match 'foo.com'\", or \"Find the table heading that's \
	got bold text, then give me that text.\""
