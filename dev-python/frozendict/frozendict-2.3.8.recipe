SUMMARY="A simple immutable dictionary for Python"
DESCRIPTION="frozendict is a simple immutable dictionary. It's fast as dict, and sometimes faster!

Unlike other similar implementations, immutability is guaranteed: you can't change the internal \
variables of the class, and they are all immutable objects. Reinvoking __init__ does not alter \
the object.

The API is the same as dict, without methods that can change the immutability. So it supports also \
fromkeys, unlike other implementations. Furthermore it can be pickled, unpickled and have an hash, \
if all values are hashable.

You can also add any dict to a frozendict using the | operator. The result is a new frozendict."
