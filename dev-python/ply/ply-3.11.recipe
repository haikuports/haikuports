SUMMARY="Python Lex & Yacc"
DESCRIPTION="PLY is yet another implementation of lex and yacc for Python. \
Some notable features include the fact that its implemented entirely in \
Python and it uses LALR(1) parsing which is efficient and well suited for \
larger grammars.

PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for \
empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for \
ambiguous grammars.

PLY is extremely easy to use and provides very extensive error checking."
