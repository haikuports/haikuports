SUMMARY="A generic syntax highlighter"
DESCRIPTION="It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds \
of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to \
prettify source code. Highlights are:

* a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
* special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting quality

simple regex-based lexing mechanism

ANSI sequences
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
* ... and it highlights even Brainf*ck!"
