SUMMARY="Turn-based tactical strategy game with a high fantasy theme"
DESCRIPTION="Build up a great army, gradually turning raw recruits into \
hardened veterans. In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a \
deadly host whom none can stand against! Choose units from a large pool of \
specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on \
different terrains against all manner of opposition.

Wesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played. Fight to regain the \
throne of Wesnoth, of which you are the legitimate heir... step into the \
boots of a young officer sent to guard a not-so-sleepy frontier outpost... \
lead a brutal quest to unite the orcish tribes... vanquish a horde of undead \
warriors unleashed by a foul necromancer, who also happens to have taken your \
brother hostage... guide a band of elvish survivors in an epic quest to find \
a new home... get revenge on the orcs by using the foul art of necromancy...

There are at least two hundred unit types, sixteen races, six major factions, \
and hundreds of years of history. The world of Wesnoth is absolutely huge and \
only limited by your creativity — make your own custom units, create your own \
maps, and write your own scenarios or even full-blown campaigns. You can also \
challenge up to eight friends—or strangers—and fight in epic multiplayer \
fantasy battles."
