SUMMARY="Make a fortune dealing drugs on the streets of New York"
DESCRIPTION="dopewars is a free Unix/Win32 rewrite of a game originally based \
on \"Drug Wars\" by John E. Dell. The idea of dopewars is to deal in drugs on \
the streets of New York, amassing a huge fortune and paying off the loan \
shark, while avoiding the ever-annoying police. The Unix/Win32 rewrite, as \
featuring a so-called \"antique\" mode which closely follows the original, \
introduces new features such as the ability to take part in multi-player \
games. dopewars aims to be highly configurable, and what you can't change in \
the configuration files you can change by poking around in the source, which \
is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

ADVISORY: dopewars is not recommended for children below 16 without parental \
supervision. We also do not condone real-life drug dealing."
