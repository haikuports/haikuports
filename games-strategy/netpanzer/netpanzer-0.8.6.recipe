SUMMARY="Online multiplayer isometric tank game"
DESCRIPTION="netPanzer is an isometric view real-time tactical game designed \
for play across the Internet and over LAN systems. One on one games are \
possible via direct connect or modem. netPanzer is designed for FAST ACTION \
combat -- it is not another resource management clone. In fact, there aren't \
any resources at all. Each player will have many units of different types at \
their disposal.\
\
Players can fight until their units are destroyed -- then respawn and keep on \
going. The game is real-time, but it's based on quick tactical action and unit \
management. Battles progress quickly and constantly; in fact, they never let \
up. There is no stop in the action because there is no waiting for resources \
to be collected and converted into weaponry. Players can join or leave \
multiplayer games at any time."
