SUMMARY="A futuristic real time strategy game"
DESCRIPTION="Bos Wars is a futuristic real time strategy game (RTS). In a RTS \
game, the player has to combat his enemies while developing his war economy. \
Everything runs in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games, where the player \
always has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance the effort put into \
building the economy and building an army to defend and attack the enemies.

Bos Wars has a dynamic rate based economy. Energy is produced by power plants \
and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile units are also \
built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of the map creates the \
potential to increase your economy throughput. Holding key points like roads \
and passages allow for different strategies.

It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or against \
the computer. Bos Wars successfully runs under Linux, MS Windows, BSD, Mac OS \
X, and Haiku."
