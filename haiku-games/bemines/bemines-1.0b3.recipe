SUMMARY="More than a near-exact clone of the classic Windows game"
DESCRIPTION="
It's about time for a more than a near-exact clone of the classic Windows game, \
Minesweeper.

Controls
- Left click: Reveal a box. Clicking on a mine will lose the game.
- Right click: Change a box to either unmarked, flagged as a mine, or a question mark.
- Middle click: Sonar ping which reveals all mines in a 3x3 square without the \
	danger of setting them off. It comes with a 20 second cost added to your \
	time. Left clicking while holding down ALT will also will do this.
- Click with both buttons: If the tile is a number and the appropriate number \
	of mines around it have been flagged, it will clear all the other squares \
	around the number. Of course, if you've made a mistake, you'll probably \
	set off a mine. Left clicking while holding down SHIFT will also \
	do this."
