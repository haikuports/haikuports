SUMMARY="More than a near-exact clone of the classic Windows game"
DESCRIPTION="It's about time for a more than a near-exact clone of the \
classic Windows game, Minesweeper.

Controls:
- Left click: Reveal a box. Clicking on a mine will lose the game.
- Right click: Change a box to either unmarked, flagged as a mine, or a \
question mark.
- Middle click: Sonar ping which reveals all mines in a 3x3 square without \
the danger of setting them off. It comes with a 20 second cost added to your \
time. Left clicking while holding down ALT will also will do this.
- Click with both buttons: If the tile is a number and the appropriate number \
of mines around it have been flagged, it will clear all the other squares \
around the number. Of course, if you've made a mistake, you'll probably \
set off a mine. Left clicking while holding down SHIFT will also do this."
