SUMMARY="A space shooter in 3D 'a la Wing Commander'"
DESCRIPTION="Year 8002. System OOLRO 3, where the oldest and mos powerful
empire ever exists : The KROSSO empire, which consists of thousands of
colonies. The celebrations of the eighth millenium have just ended and the
good days seem to be over. A few cases of an unknown sickness have been found.
Rumors are spreading of the possibility of a mind disease.

No Gravity invites you to a fantastic and futuristic universe made of five
intergalactic worlds. An arcade type game with great playability, where it is
easy to plunge into space battles against spacefighters, space stations and
more!

Fifty-five hard hitting missions plus ten training exercises will help you to
enter this real time textured 3D environment. Missions set not only in deep
space, but also inside enemy structures will have you patrolling high risk
sectors, on reconnaissance in enemy space, escorting friendly ships or
defending your space stations and even sneaking in to sabotage enemy weapons."
