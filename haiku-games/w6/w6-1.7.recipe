SUMMARY="A strategy game simulating a world wide war"
DESCRIPTION="\"What Went Wrong? it's a World Wide War!\" features a worldmap \
with every single country on this planet including Swaziland (great hello to \
all of you Swaziland BeOS users). It has real data for every country in the \
world (at least in the 70's), including population, PNB etc.
Using the editor, you can let the computer play alone and turn it in kind of \
war simulation software."
