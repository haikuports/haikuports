   This is available via a BSD license, which is stored in the source file
   "libfizmo/src/interpreter/mt19937ar.c".

   libfizmo includes hyphenation patterns provided by the hyph-utf8 project
   at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyph-utf8/. For every file's

   work is unknown. Since he released the software for free and since it is
   also used by multiple other projects it can also be distributed or used
   freely, to the best of my knowledge.
