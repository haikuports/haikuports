SUMMARY="Framework designed for remaking Thrust"
DESCRIPTION="This is a simple framework designed for remaking Thrust, the best \
game that was ever created.

So far the biggest project using the framework is klystrack, a chiptune \
tracker that uses the klystron sound engine for great success.

Some selling points:

* Sound synthesis for music and effects
* Low system requirements (the audio engine uses about 20 % CPU time on a 366 MHz Dingoo, at 22 Khz)
* Pixel-accurate sprite-sprite and sprite-background collision checking
* C99 (GNU99)
* SDL
* GUI stuff for simple mouse control

In short: the feature set is something that could be found inside an generic \
video game console circa 1991. The API is relatively simple, yet uses some \
(stupid) tricks. The main goal is to provide pixel-accurate collisions which \
is a very important feature for a thrustlike game. The synth and the music \
routine are thrown in just for fun.
