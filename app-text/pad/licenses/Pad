Pad 1.0 AAPR
(c) 1997 Jesse Hall

Pad is freeware. I certainly don't mind donations to my college fund, but I'll feel guilty if you give me more than $5 for this :-). You can distribute it freely, as long as 1) this file accompanies it, 2) neither file is modified in any way, and 3) you don't charge more than the cost of distribution. If you want to include this with a commercial product, please get my permission first.

As always, I am not legally responsible for any damage caused directly or indirectly by this application. Use it at your own risk.
