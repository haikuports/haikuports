SUMMARY="A conversion utility for EPOC32 (Psion) files"
DESCRIPTION="The Psion 5(MX) has several built-in applications. They use their \
own file formats to save data files. Psion has written file conversion \
utilities for Windows 95, in the form of their PsiWin program. But there are \
no conversion utilities for other operating systems. Also, Psion is not able \
to or does not want to release enough data for others to write their own \
conversion programs. At least, that is what I have gathered through the \
newsgroups and from other sources.

The Psion 5MX uses mostly the same file formats as the Psion 5; the conversion \
utilities seem to work, though you might get a few additional warnings. Other \
Psion PDAs might be supported too, and even other machines running EPOC32. The \
Psion Series 3 uses EPOC16, and are not supported."
