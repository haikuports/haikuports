SUMMARY="Perl script that converts Texinfo to HTML"
DESCRIPTION="Texi2HTML is a Perl script which converts Texinfo source files \
to HTML output.

This is an evolving version of the script originally developed by Lionel Cons \
and later maintained for a time by Olaf Bachmann. It now supports many \
advanced features, such as internationalization and extremely configurable \
output formats. Development of Texi2HTML moved to the GNU Texinfo repository \
in 2010, since it was meant to replace the makeinfo implementation in GNU \
Texinfo.
There was no release of GNU Texinfo with makeinfo based on Texi2HTML, \
however, because the implementation based on Texi2HTML was abandoned in favor \
of the current program in GNU Texinfo, which parses the Texinfo input into a \
tree for processing and supports nearly all the features of Texi2HTML. Latest \
Texi2HTML sources are thus in the GNU Texinfo repository, although development \
of Texi2HTML and of the Texi2HTML based makeinfo implementation stopped in 2011.

There are some differences between Texi2HTML and the GNU Texinfo \
makeinfo/texi2any implementation, even in the Texi2HTML compatibility mode, \
they are documented in the GNU Texinfo manual. Nevertheless, the route forward \
for authors is, in most cases, to alter manuals and build processes as \
necessary to use the new features of the makeinfo/texi2any implementation of \
GNU Texinfo.

The Texi2HTML maintainers (one of whom is the principal author of \
the GNU Texinfo implementation) do not intend to make further releases of \
Texi2HTML. If you have difficulties using the new implementation, you could \
try to ask on the GNU Texinfo mailing lists."
