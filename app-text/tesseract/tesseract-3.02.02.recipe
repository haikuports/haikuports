SUMMARY="An OCR Engine that was developed at HP and now at Google"
DESCRIPTION="
An OCR Engine that was developed at HP Labs between 1985 and 1995... and \
now at Google.
Tesseract is probably the most accurate open source OCR engine available. \
Combined with the Leptonica Image Processing Library it can read a wide \
variety of image formats and convert them to text in over 60 languages. \
It was one of the top 3 engines in the 1995 UNLV Accuracy test. Between \
1995 and 2006 it had little work done on it, but since then it has been \
improved extensively by Google. It is released under the Apache License \
2.0."
