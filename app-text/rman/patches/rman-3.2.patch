+<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Notes
+on Filter Types</a></h2>
 
-<h1>Notes on Filter Types</h1>
-
-<h2>ROFF</h2>
-<p>Some flavors of UNIX ship man page without [tn]roff source, making one's laser printer
-little more than a laser-powered daisy wheel.  This filer tries to intuit
-the original [tn]roff directives, which can then be recompiled by [tn]roff.</p>
-
-<h2>TkMan</h2>
-<p>TkMan, a hypertext man page browser, uses <i>PolyglotMan</i> to show
-man pages without the (usually) useless headers and footers on each
-pages.  It also collects section and (optionally) subsection heads for
-direct access from a pulldown menu.  TkMan and Tcl/Tk, the toolkit in
-which it's written, are available via anonymous ftp from
-<tt>ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/</tt></p>
-
-<h2>Tk</h2>
-
-<p>This option outputs the text in a series of Tcl lists consisting of
-text-tags pairs, where tag names roughly correspond to HTML.  This
-output can be inserted into a Tk text widget by doing an <tt>eval
-&lt;textwidget&gt; insert end &lt;text&gt;</tt>.  This format should be relatively
-easily parsible by other programs that want both the text and the
-tags.  Also see ASCII.</p>
-
-<h2>ASCII</h2>
-<p>When printed on a line printer, man pages try to produce special text effects
-by overstriking characters with themselves (to produce bold) and underscores
-(underlining).  Other text processing software, such as text editors, searchers,
-and indexers, must counteract this.  The ASCII filter strips away this formatting.
-Piping nroff output through <tt>col -b</tt> also strips away this formatting,
-but it leaves behind unsightly page headers and footers.  Also see Tk.</p>
-
-<h2>Sections</h2>
-<p>Dumps section and (optionally) subsection titles.  This might be useful for
-another program that processes man pages.</p>
-
-<h2>HTML</h2>
-<p>With a simple extention to an HTTP server for Mosaic or other World Wide Web
-browser, <i>PolyglotMan</i> can produce high quality HTML on the fly.
-Several such extensions and pointers to several others are included in <i>PolyglotMan</i>'s
-<tt>contrib</tt> directory.</p>
-
-<h2>XML</h2>
-<p>This is appoaching the Docbook DTD, but I'm hoping that someone that someone
-with a real interest in this will polish the tags generated.  Try it to see
-how close the tags are now.</p>
-
-<p>Improved by Aaron Hawley, but still he notes
-<blockquote>
-Output requires human intervention to become proper
-DocBook format. This is a result of the fundamental
-nature of nroff and DocBook xml. One is marked for
-formating the other is marked for semantics (defining
-what the content is rather then what it should look
-like). For instance, italics and bold formatting are
-converted to emphasis and command DocBook elements
-respectively even though they should probably be marked
-up as command, option, literal, arg, option and other
-possible DocBook tags.
-</blockquote>
-</p>
-
-<h2>MIME</h2>
-<p>MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) as defined by RFC 1563,
-good for consumption by MIME-aware e-mailers or as Emacs (>=19.29)
-enriched documents.</p>
-
-<h2>LaTeX and LaTeX2e</h2>
-Why not?
-
-<h2>RTF</h2>
-<p>Use output on Mac or NeXT or whatever.  Maybe take random man pages
-and integrate with NeXT's documentation system better.  Maybe NeXT has
-own man page macros that do this.</p>
-
-<h2>PostScript and FrameMaker</h2>
-<p>To produce PostScript, use <tt>groff</tt> or <tt>psroff</tt>.  To produce FrameMaker MIF,
-use FrameMaker's built-in filter.  In both cases you need <tt>[tn]roff</tt> source,
-so if you only have a formatted version of the manual page, use <i>PolyglotMan</i>'s
-roff filter first.</p>
-
-
-<h1>Examples</h1>
-
-<p>To convert the <i>formatted</i> man page named <tt>ls.1</tt> back into
-[tn]roff source form:</p>
-
+<h3><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Roff</a></h3>
+Some flavors of UNIX ship man page without [tn]roff
+source, making  one&rsquo;s laser printer little more than a laser-powered daisy
+wheel.  This filter tries to intuit the original [tn]roff directives,  which
+can then be recompiled by [tn]roff.  
+<h3><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>TkMan</a></h3>
+TkMan(1)
+, a hypertext man page
+browser, uses <i>PolyglotMan </i>  to show man pages without the (usually) useless
+headers and footers  on each page. It also collects section and (optionally)
+subsection  heads for direct access from a pulldown menu. TkMan and Tcl/Tk,
+ the toolkit in which it&rsquo;s written, are available via anonymous  ftp from
+<a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/"><i>ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/ </i></a> 
+<h3><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Tk</a></h3>
+This option outputs the text in a series of
+Tcl lists consisting  of text-tags pairs, where tag names roughly correspond
+to HTML.  This output can be inserted into a Tk text widget by doing an
+<i> eval &lt;textwidget&gt; insert end &lt;text&gt; </i>. This format should be  relatively easily
+parsible by other programs that want both the  text and the tags. See also
+ASCII.

+filter strips away this formatting. Piping nroff  output through <i>col -b </i>
+also strips away this formatting,  but it leaves behind unsightly page
+headers and footers. Also  see Tk.  
+<h3><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Sections</a></h3>
+Dumps section and (optionally)
+subsection titles. This might  be useful for another program that processes
+man pages.  
+<h3><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>HTML</a></h3>
+With a simple extention to a HTTP server for Mosaic(1)
+ or
+other  World Wide Web browser, <i>PolyglotMan </i> can produce high quality  HTML
+on the fly. Several such extensions and pointers to several  others are
+included in <i>PolyglotMan </i>&rsquo;s <i>contrib </i> directory.  
+<h3><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Sgml</a></h3>
+This is appoaching the
+Docbook DTD, but I&rsquo;m hoping that someone  with a real interest in this will
+polish the tags  generated. Try it to see how close the tags are now.  
+<h3><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>MIME</a></h3>
+MIME
+(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) as defined by RFC 1563,  good for
+consumption by MIME-aware e-mailers or as Emacs (&gt;=19.29)  enriched documents.
+ 
+<h3><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>LaTeX and LaTeX2e</a></h3>
+Why not?  
+<h3><a name='sect14' href='#toc14'>Rtf</a></h3>
+Use output on Mac or NeXT or whatever. Maybe
+take random man  pages and integrate them better with NeXT&rsquo;s documentation
+system.  Maybe NeXT has its own man page macros that do this.  
+<h3><a name='sect15' href='#toc15'>PostScript
+and FrameMaker</a></h3>
+To produce PostScript, use <i>groff </i> or <i>psroff </i>. To  produce
+FrameMaker MIF, use FrameMaker&rsquo;s builtin filter. In both  cases you need
+<i>[tn]roff </i> source, so if you only have a  formatted version of the manual
+page, use <i>PolyglotMan </i>&rsquo;s  roff filter first.  
+<h2><a name='sect16' href='#toc16'>Examples</a></h2>
+To convert the <i>formatted
+</i> man page named <i>ls.1 </i> back  into [tn]roff source form:  <p>
+<i>rman -f roff /usr/local/man/cat1/ls.1
+&gt; /usr/local/man/man1/ls.1 </i> <br>
 <p>
-    <tt>rman -f roff /usr/local/man/cat1/ls.1 > /usr/local/man/man1/ls.1</tt><br>
-
-<p>Long man pages are often compressed to conserve space (compression is
-especially effective on formatted man pages as many of the characters
-are spaces).  As it is a long man page, it probably has subsections,
-which we try to separate out (some macro sets don't distinguish
-subsections well enough for <i>PolyglotMan</i> to detect them).  Let's convert
-this to LaTeX format:<br>

-
-<p>Alternatively,
-
-    <tt>man 1 automount | rman -b -n automount -s 1 -f latex > automount.man</tt><br>
-
-<p>For HTML/Mosaic users, <i>PolyglotMan</i> can, without modification of the
-source code, produce HTML links that point to other HTML man pages
-either pregenerated or generated on the fly.  First let's assume
-pregenerated HTML versions of man pages stored in <i>/usr/man/html</i>.
-Generate these one-by-one with the following form:<br>
-
-    <tt>rman -f html -r 'http:/usr/man/html/%s.%s.html' /usr/man/cat1/ls.1 > /usr/man/html/ls.1.html</tt><br>
-
-<p>If you've extended your HTML client to generate HTML on the fly you should use
-something like:<br>
-
-    <tt>rman -f html -r 'http:~/bin/man2html?%s:%s' /usr/man/cat1/ls.1</tt><br>
-
-when generating HTML.</p>
-
-
-<h1>Bugs/Incompatibilities</h1>
-
-<p><i>PolyglotMan</i> is not perfect in all cases, but it usually does a
-good job, and in any case reduces the problem of converting man pages
-to light editing.</p>
-
-<p>Tables in formatted pages, especially H-P's, aren't handled very well.
-Be sure to pass in source for the page to recognize tables.</p>
-
-<p>The man pager <i>woman</i> applies its own idea of formatting for
-man pages, which can confuse <i>PolyglotMan</i>.  Bypass <i>woman</i>
-by passing the formatted manual page text directly into
-<i>PolyglotMan</i>.</p>
-
-<p>The [tn]roff output format uses fB to turn on boldface.  If your macro set
-requires .B, you'll have to a postprocess the <i>PolyglotMan</i> output.</p>
