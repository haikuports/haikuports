SUMMARY="A document formating system"
DESCRIPTION="Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by Jeffrey Kingston at \
the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of Sydney, Australia.

The system reads a high-level description of a document similar in style to LaTeX and produces a \
PostScript file which can be printed on most laser printers and graphic display devices.
Plain text output is also available, PDF output is limited but working (e.g. no graphics).
Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy.

The Lout package for Haiku includes includes documentation in PDF format, so people new to Lout \
have an easier time learning how to use it. The files will be located under:

/boot/system/documentation/packages/$portName/

* slides.pdf serves as a short introduction to Lout's capabilities.
* user.pdf offers a very complete documentation. \"Appendix A\" contains a nice quick-reference guide!
* expert.pdf and design.pdf will serve well the more advanced users.

When working with Lout files under Haiku, using the Pe editor can be convenient, as it includes \
special supports for them (syntax coloring, content navigation, etc)."
