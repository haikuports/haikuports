SUMMARY="Calculate correct bounding boxes for PostScript and PDF files"
DESCRIPTION="ps2eps is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files \
(EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for \
those EPS files and filters some special postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous \
results on printers. EPS files are often needed for including (scalable) graphics of high quality \
into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents. Included graphics can be clipped to their bounding box.

Nowadays PDF is more widely used, but the original problems described below still exist: pdfcrop \
sometimes does not produce the correct bounding box. This program can be used together with \
pdfcrop in order to produce reliable bounding boxes for PDF files, too.

Other programs like ps2epsi do not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the \
values are put on the postscript stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript code) or rounded \
it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some part of the image. ps2eps uses a double precision \
resolution of 144 dpi and appropriate rounding to get a proper bounding box. The internal bbox \
device of ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even incorrect), so using the \
provided bbox should be more robust. However, because normal clipping has only a resolution of \
1/72dpi (postscript point), the clipping process may still erase parts of your EPS image. In this \
case please use the -l option to add an additional point of white space around the tight bounding \
box."
