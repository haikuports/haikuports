SUMMARY="Generic spell-checking dictionary library"
DESCRIPTION="Enchant is also meant to be used in a cross-platform (XP) \
environment. Part of this means that Enchant wants to limit its number of \
external dependencies to 0, or as close is as humanly possible. Also, any \
enchant consumer (i.e. a Word Processor) should not need to know about what \
backend providers Enchant knows about. In fact, Enchant shouldn't even need \
to know this information itself. To accomplish this, all of Enchant's \
providers are DLLs.\
Enchant is also meant to be used in a multi-user environment, such as Unix.\
It is preferable to have both a \$USER and a \$GLOBAL location for both \
provider DLLs and for dictionaries themselves, when possible. Enchant's DLL\
location algorithm takes this into account, and gives preference to the \$USER \
DLLs, when found."
