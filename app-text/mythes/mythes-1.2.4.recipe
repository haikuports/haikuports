SUMMARY="A simple thesaurus"
DESCRIPTION="MyThes is a simple thesaurus that used a structured text \
data file and an index file with binary search to lookup words \
and phrases and return information on part of speech, \
meanings, and synonyms.

- written in C++ to make it easier to interface with \
LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Pspell, etc
- it is stateless, uses no static variables and \
should be completely reentrant with no ifdefs
- it compiles with -ansi and -pedantic and -Wall \
with no warnigns so it shouldbe quite portable
- it uses a simple perl program to read the structured \
text file and create the index needed for binary \
searching
- it is very simple with *lots* of comments. \
The main \"smarts\" are in the structure of the \
text file that makes up the thesaurus data
- It comes with a ready-to-go structured thesaurus \
data file for en_US extracted from the WordNet-2.0 data.
- Please see WordNet_license.txt and WordNet_readme.txt \
for more information on the very useful project!
- See http://www.danielnaber.de/wn2ooo/ for utilities to \
regenerate an up to date English thesaurus from the most \
recent WordNet data."
