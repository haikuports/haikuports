SUMMARY="Next generation ConTeXt processing engine"
DESCRIPTION="The LuaMetaTeX program is a light weight variant of LuaTeX. This program finds its \
origin in parts of TeX (the original program, eTeX (some extensions), pdfTeX (more extensions) \
Aleph (based on Omega, directions) and of course LuaTeX (lots of things).

This is a follow up on the LuaTeX project. The source is considered part of the ConTeXt \
distribution and managed by the ConTeXt development team and the ConTeXt user group. That way it \
can be guaranteed that the engine and this TeX macro package work together as expected. The idea \
is that users can easily compile the source themselves and that way have a guaranteed long term \
(minimal) TeX based installation. Because the management scripts are in Lua, only one binary is \
needed to serve the ConTeXt distribution.

In the source code it was tried to stay close to the ancestors, LuaTeX, pdfTeX, eTeX and TeX, but \
in the meantime due to additions there is quite some diverge. There are new primitives and \
submechanisms, there is more control over the inner workings, font handling is mostly delegated \
to Lua and there is no built-in backend. The code base is all-inclusive and has no (nor will \
have) dependencies on external libraries. Performance and memory consumption have been optimized \
and the additions (compared to LuaTeX) donâ€™t have a negative impact."
