SUMMARY="A DVI-to-PNG converter"
DESCRIPTION="This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX and \
its relatives.

If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using the \`dvigif' binary or with the \
\`--gif' option.

It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as fast as is possible. The \
target audience is people who need to generate and regenerate many images again and again. The \
primary target is the preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from within \
(X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs buffer, see \
\`http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/preview-latex.html'.

Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering homework problems to students \
over the internet, giving students instant feedback as to whether or not their answers are \
correct, see \`http://webwork.math.rochester.edu'.

A more recent addition to the dvipng-using applications out there is MediaWiki, the software \
behind Wikipedia and many other wikis out there. Dvipng is used to render mathematical formulae \
from version 1.8.0 of MediaWiki, see \`http://www.mediawiki.org'.

Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like \
LyX."
