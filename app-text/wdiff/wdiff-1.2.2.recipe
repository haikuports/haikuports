SUMMARY="Compares two files word by word"
DESCRIPTION="'wdiff' is a front-end to GNU 'diff'.  It compares two files, finding \
which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create \
the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with \
terminals and pagers (notably with 'less').  'wdiff' is particularly \
useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have \
been refilled."
