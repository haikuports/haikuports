SUMMARY="A Any to PostScript filter"
DESCRIPTION="GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter.  Of course it processes plain text files, \
but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages.

Its slogan is precisely: Do The Right Thing, which means that though it is highly configurable, \
everything was made so that a novice user can do complicated PostScript manipulations.  For \
instance, it has the ability to delegate the processing of some files to other filters (such as \
groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), what allows a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection, duplex \
etc.) of heterogeneous files."
