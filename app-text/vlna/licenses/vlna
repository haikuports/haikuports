The program may be freely used. If somebody makes useful changes
in the CWEB source code, I want to be informed about it. The 
modified version must not be distributed under the same name
without author's consent. 

The author gives no warranty that the program will not damage your
file that you have been editing for many hours. Although the program
creates backup files, these files are deleted after subsequent use
of the program.
