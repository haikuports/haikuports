SUMMARY="A filter that blocks the touchpad while typing"
DESCRIPTION="Most OSs have drivers for laptops which will allow the automatic \
dismissal of mouse-down events while typing. In other words: you accidentally \
produce mouse clicks on your touchpad while typing.
Haiku doesn't have that functionality yet.

The first time the filter is run, it will make a default settings file in \
~/config/settings named "PadBlocker_settings". This is just a text file, \
containing a number representing in milliseconds (1/1000 secs) the delay \
between when the last key-up message is handled and when the next mouse-down \
message will be allowed.
You can set this number to whatever you want, but I imagine anything more than \
500 (half a second) would be counter-productive.

Since the threshold is loaded on instantiation of the filter (i.e. when the \
input_server is fired up) any changes you make won't be noticed until the \
server is restarted, manually, or on reboot.

To restart the input_server manually, open the Terminal and type:   
	/system/servers/input_server -q

The mouse and keyboard will go dead for a second or two as the input server \
restarts, and the add-ons are loaded."
