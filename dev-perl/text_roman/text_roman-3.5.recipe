SUMMARY="Allows conversion between Roman and Arabic algarisms"
DESCRIPTION="This package supports both conventional Roman algarisms (which range from 1 to 3999) \
and Milhar Romans, a variation which uses a bar across the algarism to indicate multiplication by \
1_000. For the purposes of this module, acceptable syntax consists of an underscore suffixed to \
the algarism e.g. IV_V = 4_005. The term Milhar apparently derives from the Portuguese word for \
\"thousands\" and the range of this notation extends the range of Roman numbers to 3999 * 1000 + \
3999 = 4_002_999.
Note: the functions in this package treat Roman algarisms in a case-insensitive manner such that \
\"VI\" == \"vI\" == \"Vi\" == \"vi\"."
