SUMMARY="An exporter with the features of Sub::Exporter but only core dependencies"
DESCRIPTION="Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features including \
renaming imported functions with the -as, -prefix and -suffix options; explicit destinations with \
the into option; and alternative installers with the installer option. But it's written in only \
about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.
Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration done through the \
@EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables."
