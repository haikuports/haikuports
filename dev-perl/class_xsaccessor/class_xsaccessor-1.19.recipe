SUMMARY="Generate fast XS accessors without runtime compilation"
DESCRIPTION="Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write accessors in XS. \
Additionally, it can provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing whether the attribute foo \
exists in the object (which is different from \"is defined within the object\"). It only works \
with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes. Class::XSAccessor::Array implements the \
same interface for objects that use arrays for their internal representation."
