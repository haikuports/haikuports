BUILD()

	# Makefile.PL checks whether gcc works to add a dependency on Ref::Util::XS.
	# We just add that unconditionally so that users can use the faster implementation,
	# the compiler check isn't needed.

	make pure_install

	cd $prefix

{
	# The tests are using the XS implementation when available (see TEST_REQUIRES),
	# but Ref::Util::XS isn't displayed in requirements because Makefile.PL was
	# run without gcc available.
