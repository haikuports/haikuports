SUMMARY="Portably perform operations on file names"
DESCRIPTION="This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file \
specifications (usually called 'file names', but not to be confused with the contents of a file, \
or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating several directory and file names into a single \
path, or determining whether a path is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker \
5.17, code written by Andreas KÃ¶nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya Zakharevich, \
Paul Schinder, and others."
