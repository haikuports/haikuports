SUMMARY="Provide https support for LWP::UserAgent"
DESCRIPTION="The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using https schemed URLs with \
LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so you don't use it directly. Once \
the module is installed LWP is able to access sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and neither SSL_ca_file nor \
SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be the one provided by Mozilla::CA. If the \
Mozilla::CA module isn't available SSL requests will fail. Either install this module, set up an \
alternative SSL_ca_file or disable hostname verification.
This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in v6.02 in order to be \
able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN tool-chain. Applications that need https \
support can just declare their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know \
what underlying modules to install."
