SUMMARY="Skip tests when modules not available"
DESCRIPTION="Skip test scripts if modules are not available. The requested modules will be \
loaded, and optionally have their versions checked. If the module is missing, the test script \
will be skipped. Modules that are found but fail to compile will exit with an error rather than \
skip.
If used in a subtest, the remainder of the subtest will be skipped.
Skipping will work even if some tests have already been run, or if a plan has been declared.
Versions are checked via a \$module->VERSION(\$wanted_version) call. Versions must be provided in \
a format that will be accepted. No extra processing is done on them.
If perl is used as a module, the version is checked against the running perl version (\$]). The \
version can be specified as a number, dotted-decimal string, v-string, or version object.
If the RELEASE_TESTING environment variable is set, the tests will fail rather than skip. \
Subtests will be aborted, but the test script will continue running after that point."
