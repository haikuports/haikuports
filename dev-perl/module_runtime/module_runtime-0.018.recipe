SUMMARY="Runtime module handling"
DESCRIPTION="The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl modules, \
which are normally handled at compile time. This module avoids using any other modules, so that \
it can be used in low-level infrastructure.
The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same syntax that is used for \
barewords in Perl source. In principle this syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and this \
module applies the syntax of the Perl on which it is running. In practice the usable syntax \
hasn't changed yet. There's some intent for Unicode module names to be supported in the future, \
but this hasn't yet amounted to any consistent facility.
The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include workarounds for three old \
Perl core bugs regarding require. These workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the \
bugs exist, except for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure \
Perl."
