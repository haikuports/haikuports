SUMMARY="Extremely flexible deep comparison"
DESCRIPTION="Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you got is the \
result you were expecting. At its simplest it compares two structures by going through each \
level, ensuring that the values match, that arrays and hashes have the same elements and that \
references are blessed into the correct class. It also handles circular data structures without \
getting caught in an infinite loop.

Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something besides simple exact \
comparisons. With strings, the eq operator checks that 2 strings are exactly equal but sometimes \
that's not what you want. When you don't know exactly what the string should be but you do know \
some things about how it should look, eq is no good and you must use pattern matching instead. \
Test::Deep provides pattern matching for complex data structures."
