SUMMARY="Perform diffs on files and record sets"
DESCRIPTION="diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility. It is not \
anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better integrated with Perl and \
available on all platforms. It is often faster than shelling out to a system's diff executable \
for small files, and generally slower on larger files.

Relies on Algorithm::Diff for, well, the algorithm. This may not produce the same exact diff as \
a system's local diff executable, but it will be a valid diff and comprehensible by patch. We \
haven't seen any differences between Algorithm::Diff's logic and GNU diff's, but we have not \
examined them to make sure they are indeed identical."
