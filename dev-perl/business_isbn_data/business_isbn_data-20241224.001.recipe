SUMMARY="Data pack for Business::ISBN"
DESCRIPTION="You don't need to load this module yourself in most cases. Business::ISBN will load \
it when it loads. You must use Business::ISBN 3.005 or later because the data structure changed \
slightly to fix a bug with ISBN13 prefixes.
These data are generated from the RangeMessage.xml file provided by the ISBN Agency. The \
distributed version matches the date in the version for this module. You can retrieve this \
yourself at https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation. This file is included as \
part of the distribution and should be installed at ~lib/Business/ISBN/Data/RangeMessage.xml.
If you want to use a different RangeMessage.xml file, you can set the ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE \
environment variable to the alternate location before you load Business::ISBN. This way, you can \
use the latest (or even earlier) data without having to install something new or wait for an \
update to this module.
If the default RangeMessage.xml or your alternate one is not available, the module falls back to \
data included in Data.pm. However, that data are likely to be older. If it does not find that \
file, it looks for RangeMessage.xml in the current directory.
The data are in %Business::ISBN::country_data (although the \"country\" part is historical). If \
you want to see where the data are from, check $Business::ISBN::country_data{_source}."
