SUMMARY="Low-level HTTP connection (client)"
DESCRIPTION="The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client. An instance of the Net::HTTP class \
represents a connection to an HTTP server. The HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616. The \
Net::HTTP class supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.
Net::HTTP is a sub-class of one of IO::Socket::IP (IPv6+IPv4), IO::Socket::INET6 (IPv6+IPv4), or \
IO::Socket::INET (IPv4 only). You can mix the methods described below with reading and writing \
from the socket directly. This is not necessary a good idea, unless you know what you are doing."
