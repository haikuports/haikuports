SUMMARY="The World-Wide Web library for Perl"
DESCRIPTION="The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple and \
consistent application programming interface (API) to the World-Wide Web. The main focus of the \
library is to provide classes and functions that allow you to write WWW clients. The library also \
contain modules that are of more general use and even classes that help you implement simple HTTP \
servers.
Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API. The user agent, requests sent and \
responses received from the WWW server are all represented by objects. This makes a simple and \
powerful interface to these services. The interface is easy to extend and customize for your own \
needs.
The main features of the library are:
* Contains various reusable components (modules) that can be used separately or together.
* Provides an object oriented model of HTTP-style communication. Within this framework we \
currently support access to http, https, gopher, ftp, news, file, and mailto resources.
* Provides a full object oriented interface or a very simple procedural interface.
* Supports the basic and digest authorization schemes.
* Supports transparent redirect handling.
* Supports access through proxy servers.
* Provides parser for robots.txt files and a framework for constructing robots.
* Supports parsing of HTML forms.
* Implements HTTP content negotiation algorithm that can be used both in protocol modules and in \
server scripts (like CGI scripts).
* Supports HTTP cookies.
* Some simple command line clients, for instance lwp-request and lwp-download."
