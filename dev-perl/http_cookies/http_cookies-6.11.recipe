SUMMARY="HTTP cookie jars"
DESCRIPTION="This class is for objects that represent a \"cookie jar\" -- that is, a database of \
all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows about.
Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both store and retrieve \
information on the client side of the connection. For more information about cookies refer to \
Cookie Spec and Cookie Central. This module also implements the new style cookies described in \
RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed to be able to coexist happily.
Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of Set-Cookie2: and \
Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to initialize Cookie-headers in \
HTTP::Request objects. The state of a HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files."
