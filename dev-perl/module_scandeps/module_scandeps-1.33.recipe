SUMMARY="Scan file prerequisites"
DESCRIPTION="scandeps.pl is a simple-minded utility that prints out the PREREQ_PM section needed \
by modules.

If the option -T is specified and you have CPANPLUS installed, modules that are part of an \
earlier module's distribution with be denoted with S; modules without a distribution name on CPAN \
are marked with ?.

Also, if the -B option is specified, module belongs to a perl distribution on CPAN (and thus \
uninstallable by CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS.pm) are marked with C.

Finally, modules that has loadable shared object files (usually needing a compiler to install) \
are marked with X; with the -V flag, those files (and all other files found) will be listed \
before the main output. Additionally, all module files that the scanned code depends on but were \
not found (and thus not scanned recursively) are listed. These may include genuinely missing \
modules or false positives. That means, modules your code does not depend on (on this particular \
platform) but that were picked up by the heuristic anyway."
