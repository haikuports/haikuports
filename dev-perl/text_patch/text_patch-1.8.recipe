SUMMARY="Get information about a class and its structure"
DESCRIPTION="Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or all of \
this information can be found in other ways, but they aren't always very friendly, and usually \
involve a relatively high level of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. \
Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface to this information."
