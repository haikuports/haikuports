SUMMARY="Variable ties made easier: much, much, much easier"
DESCRIPTION="This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of tie objects without \
creating a complete class. It does so in such a way as to try and make the programmers life \
easier when it comes to single-use ties that I find myself wanting to use from time-to-time.

The Tie::Simple package is actually a front-end to other classes which really do all the work \
once tied, but this package does the dwimming to automatically figure out what you're trying to do.

I've tried to make this as intuitive as possible and dependent on other bits of Perl where I can \
to minimize the need for documentation and to make this extra, extra spiffy."
