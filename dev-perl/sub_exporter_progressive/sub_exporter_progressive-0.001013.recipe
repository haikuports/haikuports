SUMMARY="Only use Sub::Exporter if you need it"
DESCRIPTION="Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes great \
responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is a Sub::Exporter wrapper \
that will let your users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use \
Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced features, like renaming \
exports, if they try to use them.

Note that this module will export @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables for \
Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced Sub::Exporter features like \
currying, this module will only ever use Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly."
