SUMMARY="Handle Common Gateway Interface requests and responses"
DESCRIPTION="CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing HTTP \
requests and responses. Major features including processing form submissions, file uploads, \
reading and writing cookies, query string generation and manipulation, and processing and \
preparing HTTP headers.

CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also comes with built-in support \
for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as FastCGI.

It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years with input from dozens of \
contributors and being deployed on thousands of websites."
