SUMMARY="Capture STDOUT and STDERR from Perl, XS or external programs"
DESCRIPTION="Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture almost anything sent to \
STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl, from XS code or from an external \
program. Optionally, output can be teed so that it is captured while being passed through to the \
original filehandles. Yes, it even works on Windows (usually). Stop guessing which of a dozen \
capturing modules to use in any particular situation and just use this one."
