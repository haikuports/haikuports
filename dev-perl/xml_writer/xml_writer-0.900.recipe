SUMMARY="Perl extension for writing XML documents"
DESCRIPTION="XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML document. The \
module handles all escaping for attribute values and character data and constructs different \
types of markup, such as tags, comments, and processing instructions.
By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to catch errors during output. \
This behaviour can be extremely useful during development and debugging, but it can be turned off \
for production-grade code.
The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace processing mode. In Namespace mode, \
the module will generate Namespace Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on the \
output.
Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no mixed content: newlines are \
automatically inserted around elements and elements can optionally be indented based as their \
nesting level."
