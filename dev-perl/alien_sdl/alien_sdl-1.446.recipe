SUMMARY="Building, finding and using SDL binaries"
DESCRIPTION="In short Alien::SDL can be used to detect and get configuration settings from an \
installed SDL and related libraries. Based on your platform it offers the possibility to download \
and install prebuilt binaries or to build SDL & co. from source codes.

The important facts:
* The module does not modify in any way the already existing SDL installation on your system.
* If you reinstall SDL libs on your system you do not need to reinstall Alien::SDL (providing \
that you use the same directory for the new installation).
* The prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources are always installed into perl \
module's 'share' directory.
* If you use prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources it happens that some of the \
dynamic libraries (*.so, *.dll) will not automaticly loadable as they will be stored somewhere \
under perl module's 'share' directory. To handle this scenario Alien::SDL offers some special \
functionality (see below)."
