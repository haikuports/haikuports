SUMMARY="Perl implementation of the which utility as an API"
DESCRIPTION="File::Which finds the full or relative paths to executable programs on the system. \
This is normally the function of which utility. which is typically implemented as either a \
program or a built in shell command. On some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows it is not \
provided as part of the core operating system. This module provides a consistent API to this \
functionality regardless of the underlying platform.

The focus of this module is correctness and portability. As a consequence platforms where the \
current directory is implicitly part of the search path such as Microsoft Windows will find \
executables in the current directory, whereas on platforms such as UNIX where this is not the \
case executables in the current directory will only be found if the current directory is \
explicitly added to the path.

If you need a portable which on the command line in an environment that does not provide it, \
install App::pwhich which provides a command line interface to this API."
