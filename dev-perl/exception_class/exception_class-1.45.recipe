SUMMARY="A module that allows you to declare real exception classes in Perl"
DESCRIPTION="Exception::Class allows you to declare exception hierarchies in your modules in a \
\"Java-esque\" manner.

It features a simple interface allowing programmers to 'declare' exception classes at compile \
time. It also has a base exception class, Exception::Class::Base, that can be easily extended.

It is designed to make structured exception handling simpler and better by encouraging people to \
use hierarchies of exceptions in their applications, as opposed to a single catch-all exception \
class."
