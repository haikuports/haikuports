SUMMARY="A virtual layer that helps you improve privacy and anonymity"
DESCRIPTION="Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve \
their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software \
developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. \
Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow \
organizations and individuals to share information over public networks \
without compromising their privacy.
Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family \
members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like \
when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's hidden \
services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to \
reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially \
sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse \
survivors, or people with illnesses.
Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and \
dissidents. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their \
workers to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country, \
without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization.
Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members' online \
privacy and security. Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation \
(EFF) recommend Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. \
Corporations use Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to \
protect sensitive procurement patterns from eavesdroppers. They also use it to \
replace traditional VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of \
communication. Which locations have employees working late? Which locations \
have employees consulting job-hunting websites? Which research divisions are \
communicating with the company's patent lawyers?
A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and \
one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently. Law \
enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving \
government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting \
operations.
The variety of people who use Tor is actually part of what makes it so secure. \
Tor hides you among the other users on the network, so the more populous and \
diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected."
