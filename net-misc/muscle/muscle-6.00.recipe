SUMMARY="Robust, somewhat scalable, cross-platform client-server solution"
DESCRIPTION="
The MUSCLE system is a robust, somewhat scalable, cross-platform client-server \
solution for dynamic distributed applications for Haiku and other operating \
systems.
It allows (n) client programs (each of which may be running on a \
separate computer and/or under a different OS) to communicate with each other \
in a many-to-many message-passing style. It employs a central server to which \
client programs may connect or disconnect at any time (this design is similar \
to other client-server systems such as Quake servers, IRC servers, and Napster \
servers, but more general in application).
In addition to the client-server \
system, MUSCLE contains classes to support peer-to-peer message streaming \
connections, as well as some handy miscellaneous utility classes.
