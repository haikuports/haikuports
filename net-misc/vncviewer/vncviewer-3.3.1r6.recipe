SUMMARY="VNC Viewer for BeOS and Haiku"
DESCRIPTION="Connect to remote machines and view their desktop. Interact with \
them using your keyboard and mouse.

The VNC protocol is cross-platform with client and servers available on many \
operating systems. Several encoding schemes are supported to limit network \
bandwidth needs, making VNC useable even over a relatively slow network \
connection."
