SUMMARY="A Free Telnet/SSH Client"
DESCRIPTION="PPuTTY is a free implementation of SSH and Telnet for Windows \
and Unix platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator.\
LEGAL WARNING: Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries \
where encryption is outlawed. We believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP, \
PSFTP and Plink in England and Wales and in many other countries, but we \
are not lawyers, and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before \
downloading it. You may find useful information at cryptolaw.org, which \
collects information on cryptography laws in many countries, but we can't \
vouch for its correctness. \
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any \
cryptography laws."
