SUMMARY="A WPA Supplicant with support for WPA and WPA2"
DESCRIPTION="
wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Windows with \
support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for both \
desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA \
component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with \
a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 \
authentication/association of the wlan driver. wpa_supplicant is designed to \
be a "daemon" program that runs in the background and acts as the backend \
component controlling the wireless connection."
